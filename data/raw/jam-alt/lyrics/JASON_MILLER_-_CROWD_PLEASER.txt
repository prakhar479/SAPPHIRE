People gon' hate, let 'em do it (ah)
Shine like it ain't nothin' to it (that's right)
Damn, you a major influence (oh)
Skate like there ain't nothin' doin'
Live life, don't say nothin' to 'em

People gon' hate, let 'em do it (ah)
Shine like it ain't nothin' to it (that's right)
Damn, you a major influence (oh)
Skate like there ain't nothin' doin'
Live life, don't say nothin' to 'em

People tellin' lies on me
Feelin' like Pac, all eyes on me
What my next rhyme gon' be
Dull motherfuckers never ever gon' shine off me?
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Don't worry, my haters is gon' pay for it
Chase dreams but dumb niggas that chase whores
Overseas on a great tour, or maybe I'm just dreamin'
It beats bein' with demons, all niggas are schemin'
At least I'm thinkin' of an achievement
People talk shit for four seasons for no reason
People dog Lebron 'til Lebron show up
When he steps on the paint, then their guards go up
Scores go up, all the applause go up
And everybody in the whole damn court goes nuts

People gon' hate, let 'em do it (ah)
Shine like it ain't nothin' to it (that's right)
Damn, you a major influence (oh)
Skate like there ain't nothin' doin'
Live life, don't say nothin' to 'em

People gon' hate, let 'em do it (ah)
Shine like it ain't nothin' to it (that's right)
Damn, you a major influence (oh)
Skate like there ain't nothin' doin'
Live life, don't say nothin' to 'em

Spectators, sideliners
Spendin' days comin' up with sly comments
That's psychotic, why tarnish a fly product?
Why be mad just 'cause I got it? Hey
I may never know, wave to the haters
That put me on the pedestal
Talk smack, but they really know I'm incredible
Unforgettable, young blue eyes, the new guy is on schedule
Man behind bars and that's minus the federal
Stone giant, what the hell could some pebbles do
While you revel in drama, I'm buildin' revenue
Tell 'em you'll get 'em tomorrow, there ain't no stressin' you
Life goes on, life goes on
You the shit even before those lights went on
They gon' trash you even if they like your song
People always gon' judge homie right or wrong

People gon' hate, let 'em do it
Shine like it ain't nothin' to it
Damn, you're a major influence
Skate like there ain't nothin' doin'
Live life, don't say nothin' to 'em

People gon' hate, let 'em do it
Shine like it ain't nothin' to it
Damn, you're a major influence
Skate like there ain't nothin' doin'
Live life, don't say nothin' to 'em
