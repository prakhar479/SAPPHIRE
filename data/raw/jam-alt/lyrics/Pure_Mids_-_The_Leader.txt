Now that I have found you, I'm okay
But the people that surround you act strange
Will we ever fold up? Don't say
Maybe just a heads up is okay

When I am in focus, I seem blind
I can barely notice the time
Who can I believe in if not you?
You're the only reason I'm true

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I've thought enough
Should turn this around
Is this a bluff?
Should really make a sound
Am I alright?
Am I steering out of sight?
Ah-ah-ah-ight, ah-ay

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
