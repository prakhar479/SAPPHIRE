Through days of thunders
Continuing stolid smiles to wear
We're going on
We nearly carried it to the end

And every whisper
And every beat of windy heart
We're holding on
For the moment when we unite

No face
Is seen at dusk of a raining day
No name
Is spoken in a loud voice
Still, still

One day it all
Will gone forever, will gone forever
Don't close your eyes
You'll gone forever, you'll gone forever

Just reach the border
To throw your past and go ahead
Hey, light your heart
As we're led by a winding thread

No face
Is seen at dusk of a raining day
No name
Is spoken with the loud voice
Still, still

One day it all
Will gone forever, will gone forever
Don't close your eyes
You'll gone forever, you'll gone forever

And we are one, so I promise
Mmm-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

One day it all
Will gone forever, will gone forever
Don't close your eyes
You'll gone forever, you'll gone forever

There's no more pain
Which lasts forever
And never severs
Once in the end
The flame was rendered
But living embers
Will burn
