Honey, I told you something
Sorry I didn't hear
Maybe there was something
Yeah-yeah-yeah, stuck in your ear
Why is it every time you say you do, you don't?
Maybe I just thought that you were talking on the phone

Honey, you're looking lovely tonight
Sorry, you're wastin' time
Baby, this ain't your lucky night
Well, tryin' ain't a crime
Why is it every time I'd like to do, you don't?
Maybe you could try a little romance and a comb

Let's go back in time
Way back when we were
La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la
Now it's married life
And a daily strife, to be
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la

Honey, you're getting older
Yeah, and you're still 29
And maybe things are colder
But honey, still you're mine
Guess it's easy to forget
We're more than man and wife
Could it be the la-la magic keeping love alive?

Let's go back in time
Way back when we were
La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la
Back when you and I
Still had time to be
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la

Let's go back in time
Way back when
We were
La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la
Back when you and I
Still had time to be
La-la-la-la-la

Let's go back in time
Way back when we were
La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la
Now it's married life
Still we have to try, to be
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la
