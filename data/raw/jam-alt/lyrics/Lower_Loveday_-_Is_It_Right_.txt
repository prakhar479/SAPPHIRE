Late nights staying up, messaging you
Can I express what I'm feeling for you without revealing truths?

I've been thinking about you lately (lately)
That's a massive understatement, baby
I can't stop thinking about you all day and all night
Oh, but is it right?

Finally figured it out, I got my head around it
Although I know I've got to get myself out of this habit
Of falling for someone who's out of reach, it's unrealistic
My dream won't become a reality, but was it meant to be?

I've been thinking about you lately (lately)
That's a massive understatement, baby
'Cause I'm thinking about you all day and all night
Oh, but is it right?

I don't know but I, I know how it feels to me
Maybe you're just playing games, a game I don't wanna play
I don't know but I, I know how it feels to me
Maybe you're just playing games, a game I don't wanna play

I've been thinking about you lately (lately)
That's a massive understatement, baby
'Cause I'm thinking about you all day and all night
Oh, but is it right?
