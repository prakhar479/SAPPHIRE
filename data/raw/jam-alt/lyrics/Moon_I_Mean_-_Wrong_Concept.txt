Maybe you hate me
But you dress somebody's suit
Because there's no risk
To put on a mask
When we get scared to live
With our back, with our back

Maybe you love me
But you run under the sun and me under the rain
It's so easy
To lose ourselves
When we get scared to love (ooh, ooh)
With every tear, with every fear

But you could give me just your money
But I wished just your honey
Burnt your t-shirt, that one with bunny
And now about you nothing more of funny

Maybe we'll meet again
But this not the right life for us
It's so hard
To live our love
When we get scared to see (ooh, ooh)
Inside our soul, inside our soul

But you could give me just your money
But I wished just your honey
Burnt your t-shirt, that one with bunny
And now about you nothing more of funny

Your mind is closed like an aquarium
Mine completely opened like the Colosseum
So nothing about idyll between us
It's not a wrong accent
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
What's wrong is the concept
Wrong concept to love

But you could give me just your money
But I wished just your honey
Burnt your t-shirt, that one with bunny
And now about you nothing more of funny

You could give me just your money
But I wished just your honey
Burnt your t-shirt, that one with bunny
And now about you nothing more of funny

Wrong concept
Wrong concept to love
Wrong concept
To love
To love
Wrong concept
