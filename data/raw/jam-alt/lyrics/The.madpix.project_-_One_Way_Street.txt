Tears are like diamonds in my eyes
Blind me so now you're out of sight
It's enough, it's too late to break this silence

In a rose-coloured view of us
I got lost, could I realize
All your lies would be blades and knives
To stab me inside

Who will save you from this dark?
Who will fix your selfish heart?

A one way street, that's how you live
Why do you always take and never give?

Wide awake, yeah, I've crossed the line
I'm coming home
I'm running back to real life
Through the start
Where I could breathe in freely, baby

Can't you see we ran off time
Chasin' happiness while you get what you need (get what you need)

There's nothing left of us but bleeding blades and knives
Tonight you'll know how it feels

A one way street, that's how you live
Why do you always take and never give?
I'll walk away to help you see
Our love is rolling down so easily
A one way street

(Oh-oh-oh)
A one way street (oh, you're a one way street)
You never give (oh, you're a one way street)
I'll walk away (oh, you're a one way street)
So easily (oh, you're a one way street)
