Silent streets beneath my feet
City breaths and distant drums
Shadows fold where day and night meet
I keep walking, feeling numb

Pre-Chorus
Every corner holds a memory
Every step a brand new start

Chorus
I am walking through the light
Carrying the dark behind
Finding pieces of the night
That I left along the line
I keep moving toward the bright
One small heartbeat at a time

Verse 2
Window fires paint the rain
Whispers float on passing cars
Little hope dissolves my pain
I collect these fading stars

Pre-Chorus
There’s a rhythm in the silence
A soft answer in the dark

Chorus
I am walking through the light
Carrying the dark behind
Finding pieces of the night
That I left along the line
I keep moving toward the bright
One small heartbeat at a time

Bridge
If the world should close its eyes
I will learn to see by sound
If the road forgets the sky
I will hold my ground

Chorus (repeat)
I am walking through the light
Carrying the dark behind
Finding pieces of the night
That I left along the line
I keep moving toward the bright
One small heartbeat at a time

Outro
Step by step, the morning wakes
I stay true to what I find
Walking through the light I break
The small chains of my mind
