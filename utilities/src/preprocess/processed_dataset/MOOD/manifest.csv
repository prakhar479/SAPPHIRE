What hood I grew up in? The why? The who, what? When and where and the how?

And you read your Emily Dickinson, And I my Robert Frost, And we note our place with bookmarkers That measure what we've lost. Like a poem poorly written We are verses out of rhythm, Couplets out of rhyme, In syncopated time And the dangled conversation And the superficial sighs, Are the borders of our lives. Yes, we speak of things that matter, With words that must be said, ""Can analysis be worthwhile?"" ""Is the theater really dead?""

The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended), But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into the heart of the alleyway. She knew what she wanted.

What am I supposed to do now? Goodbye blackberry way I can't see you, I don't need you. Goodbye blackberry way Sure to want me back another day.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the colored America is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the colored American is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the colored American lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the colored American is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed to the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy. Now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality to all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it's colored citizens. This sweltering summer of the colored people's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the colored Americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for white only."" We cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in Mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow. I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."" I have a dream that one day out in the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!"" And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that, let freedom, ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi and every mountainside. When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ""Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.""",en,1.0,1412,7742,69,0.38526912181303113

For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen, I robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine. Now I'm 21 years, I might make 22 And I don't mind dying, but for the love of you. And if fate should break my stride Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride"" ""Come down, come down, Red Molly"" called Sergeant McRae ""For they've taken young James Adie for armed robbery. Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside. Oh come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside"" When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left He was running out of road, he was running out of breath But he smiled to see her cry He said ""I'll give you my Vincent to ride"" Says James ""In my opinion, there's nothing in this world Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl. Now Nortons and Indians and Greeves won't do, Ah, they don't have a soul like a Vincent 52"" Oh he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys Said ""I've got no further use for these. I see angels on Ariels in leather and chrome, Swooping down from heaven to carry me home"" And he gave her one last kiss and died And he gave her his Vincent to ride.",en,1.0,311,1579,11,0.617363344051447

Have you heard the story of the hot rod race, where the Fords 'n' Lincolns was settin' the pace? That story is true, I'm here to say, that I was drivin' that Model-A. It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up, that Model-A body makes it look like a pup. It's got eight cylinders and uses 'em all, got overdrive, just won't stall. With a four-barrel carb and a dual exhaust, with 4-11 gears you can really get lost. Got safety tubes but I ain't scared, the brakes are good, tires fair. Pulled outta San Pedro late one night, the moon 'n' the stars was shinin' bright. We was drivin' up Grapevine hill, passin' cars like they was standin' still. All of a sudden in the wink of an eye, Cadillac sedan passed us by. I said ""Boys that's the mark for me,"" by then the tailight was all you could see. Now the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind, so I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind. Took my foot off the gas'n'man alive, I shoved it on down into overdrive. Wound it up to a hunderd an' ten, my speedometer said that I hit top end. My foot was glued like lead to the floor, that's all there is an' there ain't no more. Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense, them telephone poles looked like a picket fence. They said ""slow down, I see spots,"" the lines on the road just looked like dots. Took a corner'n'side-swiped a truck, crossed my fingers just for luck. My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts, the guy beside me was white as a ghost. Smoke was comin' from outta the back, when started t' gain on that Cacillac. Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass, don'tcha by then we'd be low on gas. We had flames comin' from outta the side, you could feel the tension, man whatta ride. I said ""look out boys, I got a license to fly,"" and that Caddy pulled over and let us by. Now all of a sudden she started knockin' down in the dip she started to rock. And I looked in the mirror, a red light was blinkin', the cops was after my hot rod Lincoln. They arrested me 'n' they put me in jail, 'n they called my pappy to throw my bail, 'n he said ""son you're gonna drive me ta drinkin' if you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln.",en,1.0,437,2248,27,0.585812356979405

In a summertime In a summertime In a summertime My girlfriend's run off with my car, And gone back to her ma and pa, Telling tails of drunkenness and cruelty. Now I'm sitting here, Sipping at my ice cold beer, Lazing on a sunny afternoon. Help me, help me, help me sail away, Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay. 'Cause I love to live so pleasantly, Live this life of luxury, Lazing on a sunny afternoon. In a summertime In a summertime In a summertime Ah, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze.
