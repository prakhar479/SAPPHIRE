    "cleaned_text": "Nights in white satin, never reaching the end, Letters I've written, never meaning to send. Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before. Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore. 'Cos I love you, yes I love you, oh how I love you. Gazing at people, some hand in hand, Just what I'm going through they can't understand. Some try to tell me, thoughts they cannot defend, Just what you want to be, you will be in the end. And I love you, yes I love you, Oh how I love you, oh how I love you. Nights in white satin, never reaching the end, Letters I've written, never meaning to send. Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before. Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore. 'Cos I love you, yes I love you, Oh how I love you, oh how I love you. 'Cos I love you, yes I love you, Oh how I love you, oh how I love you. Breath deep The gathering gloom Watch lights fade From every room Bedsitter people Look back and lament Another day's useless Energy spent Impassioned lovers Wrestle as one Lonely man cries for love And has none New mother picks up And suckles her son Senior citizens Wish they were young Cold hearted orb That rules the night Removes the colours From our sight Red is gray and Yellow white But we decide Which is right And Which is an Illusion",
