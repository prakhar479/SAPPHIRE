    "cleaned_text": "Punctured bicycle On a hillside desolate Will nature make a man of me yet? When in this charming car This charming man Why pamper life's complexity When the leather runs smooth On the passenger seat? I would go out tonight But I haven't got a stitch to wear This man said \"it's gruesome That someone so handsome should care\" Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy Who never knew his place He said \"return the ring\" He knows so much about these things He knows so much about these things I would go out tonight But I haven't got a stitch to wear This man said \"it's gruesome That someone so handsome should care\" La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man... Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man... Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy Who never knew his place He said \"return the ring\" He knows so much about these things He knows so much about these things He knows so much about these things New York version adds : I would go out tonight But I haven't got a stitch to wear I would go out tonight But I haven't got a stitch to wear Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man...
