What you need, my son... Is a holiday in Cambodia Where people are dressed in black A holiday in Cambodia Where you'll kiss ass or crack Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot It's a holiday in Cambodia Where you'll do what you're told It's a holiday in Cambodia Where the slums got so much soul Pol Pot",
