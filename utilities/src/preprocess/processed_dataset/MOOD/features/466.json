    "cleaned_text": "I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead I just need some place where I can lay my head Hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed? He just grinned and shook my hand, \"No\" was all he said. [Chorus] Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free Take a load off Fanny, and you put the load right on me I picked up my bags, I went looking for a place to hide When I saw old Carmen and the Devil, walking side by side I said, \"Hey, Carmen, c'mon, let's go downtown\" She said, \"I gotta go, but my friend can stick around\" [Chorus] Go down, Miss Moses, ain't nothin' you can say It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgment day Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Annalee He said, \"Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Annalee company\" [Chorus] Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog Said, \"I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog\" I said, \"Wait a minute Chester, you know, I'm a peaceful man\" He said, \"That's OK, boy, won't you feed him when you can\" [Chorus] Catch the cannonball, now to take me down the line My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one Who sent me here, with her regards for everyone [Chorus]",
