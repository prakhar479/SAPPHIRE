    "cleaned_text": "Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich And welcome me back to town Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor And I'll show you how it all went down Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels And a good saloon in every single town Oh, and I remember something you once told me And I'll be damned if it did not come true Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down And they all lead me straight back home to you `Cause I headed West to grow up with the country Across those prairies with the waves of grain And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee We flew straight across that river bridge, last night a half past two The switchman wave his lantern goodbye and so long as we went rolling through Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel And now I know just what I have to do And the man on the radio won't leave me alone He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee The news I could bring I met up with the king On his head an amphetamine crown He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt And lighted out for some desert town Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels And a good saloon in every single town Oh, but I remembered something you once told me And I'll be damned if it did not come true Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down And they all lead me straight back home to you Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down And they all lead me straight back home to you",
