    "cleaned_text": "When I look in the mirror I can't believe what I see Tell me, who's that funky dude Staring back at me Broken, beaten down Can't even get around Without an old-man cane I fall and hit the ground Shivering in the cold I'm bitter and alone Excuse the bitching I shouldn't complain I should have no feeling Cos feeling is pain As everything I need Is denied me And everything I want Is taken away from me But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me And I don't wanna be an old man anymore It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night It's time I got back to the good life It's time I got back, it's time I got back And I don't even know how I got off the track I wanna go back, yeah! Screw this crap, I've had it! I ain't no Mr. Cool I'm a pig, I'm a dog So excuse me if I drool I ain't gonna hurt nobody Ain't gonna cause a scene Just need to admit That I want sugar in my tea Hear me (hear me) I want sugar in my tea! I don't wanna be an old man anymore It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night It's time I got back to the good life It's time I got back, it's time I got back And I don't even know how I got off the track I wanna go back, yeah! I wanna go back, I wanna go back And I don't even know how I got off the track It's time I got back, it's time I got back And I don't even know how I got off the track I wanna go back, yeah! And I don't wanna be an old man anymore It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night It's time I got back to the good life It's time I got back, it's time I got back And I don't even know how I got off the track It's time I got back, it's time I got back And I don't even know how I got off the track I wanna go back (I wanna go back)",
