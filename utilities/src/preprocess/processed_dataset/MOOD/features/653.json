Don't don't don't let's start This is the worst part Could believe for all the world That you're my precious little girl But don't don't don't let's start I've got a weak heart And I don't get around how you get around No one in the world ever gets what they want and that is beautiful Everybody dies frustrated and sad and that is beautiful They want what they're not and I wish they would stop saying, Deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa Deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa D, world destruction Over and overture N, do I need Apostrophe T, need this torture? Don't don't don't let's start This is the worst part Could believe for all the world That you're my precious little girl But don't don't don't let's start I've got a weak heart And I don't get around how you get around I don't want to live in this world anymore I don't want to live in this world Don't don't don't let's start This is the worst part Could believe for all the world That you're my precious little girl But don't don't don't let's start I've got a weak heart And I don't get around how you get around",
