    "cleaned_text": "Working the village shop Putting a poster up Dreaming of anything Dreaming of the time when you are free from all the trouble you're in In the mud, on your knees Trying hard not to please Anyone, all the time Being a rebel's fine But you go all the way to being brutal You will have a boy tonight You will have a boy tonight On the first bus out of town On the first bus out of town Let's see your kit for games All the girls look the same You are challenging style for running miles You're running miles in some boys jumper Boo to the business world! You know a girl who's tax free on her back and making Plenty cash While you are working for the joy of giving You will have a boy tonight You will have a boy tonight And you hope that she will see And you hope that she will see You will have a boy tonight Or maybe you will have a girl tonight And you hope that she will see And you hope that she will see You are in two minds Tossing a coin to decide whether you should tell your mum About a dose of thrush you got while you were licking railings But you read in a book That you got free in Boots There are lotions, there are potions You can take to hide your shame from all those prying eyes Lazy Jane, all the time Painting lines You are sleeping at bus stops Wondering how you got your name And what you're going to do about it You will have a boy tonight You will have a boy tonight And you hope that she will see And you hope that she will see",
