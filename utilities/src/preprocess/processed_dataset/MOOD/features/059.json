    "cleaned_text": "Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door Last night a little angel Came pumping cross my floor She said \"Come on baby I got a licence for love And if it expires pray help from above\" In the midnight hour she cried- \"more, more, more\" With a rebel yell she cried- \"more, more, more\" In the midnight hour babe- \"more, more, more\" With a rebel yell- \"more, more, more\" More, more, more. She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed What set you free and brought you to be me babe What set you free I need you hear by me Because In the midnight hour she cried- \"more, more, more\" With a rebel yell she cried- \"more, more, more\" In the midnight hour babe- \"more, more, more\" With a rebel yell- \"more, more, more\" He lives in his own heaven Collects it to go from the seven eleven Well he's out all night to collect a fare Just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair. I walked the world with you, babe A thousand miles with you I dried your tears of pain, babe A million times for you I'd sell my soul for you babe For money to burn with you I'd give you all, and have none, babe Just, just, justa, justa to have you here by me Because In the midnight hour she cried- \"more, more, more\" With a rebel yell she cried- \"more, more, more\" In the midnight hour babe- \"more, more, more\" With a rebel yell she cried \"more, more, more\" More, more, more. Oh yeah little angel she want more More, more, more, more, more. Oh yeah little angel she want more More, more, more, more.",
