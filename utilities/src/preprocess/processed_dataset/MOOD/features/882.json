I'm starting to think that everything stinks That I could really use a drink Then I got up and hit my head on the sink. Father father father father, do you call Father father father, should I end it all. Now, here comes the song I love so much Makes me want to go fuck shit up Now, I got Nirvana in my head I'm so glad I'm not dead I slam my hand in the car door I scream 'till I could scream no more Bloody and mean and rotten to the core Father father father father, do you call Satan Satan Satan, should I end it all You try to get off the ground But you always end up coming down When the sound comes around and goes in your ears You can do anything you have no fears When that sound comes around and goes in my ears I can do anything I have no fears Now, here comes the song I love so much Makes me want to go fuck shit up I got Nirvana in my head I'm so glad I'm not dead Here comes the song, I love it so much Makes me want to go fuck shit up Now, I got Nirvana in my head I'm so glad I'm not dead",
