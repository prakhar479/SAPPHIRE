Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong? Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song They said we'd be artistically free When we signed that bit of paper They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee An' worry about it later Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand Ooh ooh ooh complete control - lemme see your other hand! All over the news spread fast They're dirty, they're filthy They ain't gonna last! This is Joe Public speaking I'm controlled in the body, controlled in the mind Total See-o-n control - that means you!",
