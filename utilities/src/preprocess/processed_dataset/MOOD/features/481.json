    "cleaned_text": "We lay on the bed there Kissing just for practice Could we please be objective? Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us A hand over my mouth A hand over the window Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle Then we should be ok, and we won't get into trouble Cause we're seeing other people At least that's what we say we are doing How are you feeling? I don't think you can be dealing With the situation very well You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's ok But when it's over You are looking at the working week in the eyes of a gigolo You're kissing your elbow You're kissing your reflection And you can't understand why all the other boys are going for the New, tall, elegant rich kids I'll admit it is a bitch, kid But if they don't see the quality then it is apparent that You're going to have to change Or you're going to have to go with girls You might be better off At least they know what they're doing We lay on the bed there Kissing just for practice Could we please be objective? Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us A hand over my mouth A hand over the window Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle Then we should be ok, and we won't get into trouble Cause we're seeing other people At least that's what we say we are doing",
