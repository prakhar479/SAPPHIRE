Oh, now.. But every girl I've ever had, Breaks my heart and leave me sad. What am I, what am I supposed to do. Oh... Anna, Just one more thing, girl. You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free, Go with him. Chorus Anna, Just one more thing, girl. You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free, Go with him. you can go with him, girl Go with him",
