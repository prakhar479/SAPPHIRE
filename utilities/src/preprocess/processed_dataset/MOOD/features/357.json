Come let us meet them Yes, we will greet them Children are clapping Children are caring Children are shattering records and rules Little hands caring Little hands sharing The old ones and the gold ones and the family jewels Come let us meet them Yes, we will greet them Little hands clapping Children are happy Little hands loving all 'round the world Little hands clasping Truth they are grasping A world with no pain for one and all And they are learning Their souls, they are yearning A nice place to play and no place to fall Come let us meet them Ah, yes, we will greet them",
