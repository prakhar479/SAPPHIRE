    "cleaned_text": "Ever seen a blind man cross the road Trying to make the other side? Ever seen a young girl growing old Trying to make herself a bride? So what becomes of you my love When they have finally stripped you of The handbags and the gladrags That your grandad had to sweat so you could buy. Baby Once I was a young man And all I thought I had to do was smile. You are still a young girl, And you bought everything in style. Listen But once you think you're in you're out 'Cause you dont mean a single thing without The handbags and the gladrags That your grandad had to sweat so you could buy. Sing a song of six-pence for your sake And take a bottle full of rye. Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake, And bake them all in a pie. They told me you missed school today, So what I suggest: you just throw them all away, The handbags and the gladrags That your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy. They told me you missed school today, So I suggest you just throw them all away, The handbags and the gladrags That your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy ya.",
