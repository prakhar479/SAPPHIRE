    "cleaned_text": "I hear the clock, it's 6am I feel so far from where I've been I got my eggs and I've got my pancakes too I got my maple syrup, everything but you I break the yolks and make a smiley face I kinda like it in my brand new place Wipe the spots off all the mirror Don't leave the keys in the door I never put wet towels on the floor anymore Cause\u2026 Dreams last so long Even after you're gone I know, that you love me And soon you will see You were meant for me And I was meant for you I called my momma, she was out for a walk Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news More hearts being broken and more people being used Put on my coat in the pouring rain I saw a movie but it just wasn't the same Cause it was happy or I was sad And it made me miss you oh so bad Cause\u2026 Dreams last so long Even after you're gone I know, that you love me And soon you will see You were meant for me And I was meant for you I go about my business, I'm doing fine Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line Same old story, not much to say Hearts are broken every day I brush my teeth and put the cap back on I know you hate it when I leave the light on I pick a book up, and then I turn the sheets down And then I take a deep breath and a good look around Put on my pj's and hop into bed I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead I try and tell myself it will be all right I just shouldn't think anymore tonight Cause\u2026 Dreams last so long Even after you're gone And I know, you love me And soon i know you will see You were meant for me And I was meant for you Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you",
