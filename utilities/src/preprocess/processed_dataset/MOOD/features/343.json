But there's a full moon risin' Let's go dancin' in the light We know where the music's playin' Let's go out and feel the night. Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon. When we were strangers I watched you from afar When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart. But now it's gettin' late And the moon is climbin' high I want to celebrate See it shinin' in your eye. Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon.",
