Two lovers entwined pass me by And heaven knows I'm miserable now I was looking for a job, and then I found a job And heaven knows I'm miserable now In my life Oh, why do I give valuable time To people who don't care if I live or die? What she asked of me at the end of the day Caligula would have blushed \"You've been in the house too long\" she said And I (naturally) fled In my life Why do I smile At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye? I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour But heaven knows I'm miserable now \"You've been in the house too long\" she said And I (naturally) fled In my life Why do I give valuable time To people who don't care if I live or die?",
