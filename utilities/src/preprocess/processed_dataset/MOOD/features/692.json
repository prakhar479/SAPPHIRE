    "cleaned_text": "Mary Provost did not look her best The day the cops bust into her loneiy nest In the cheap hotel up on Hollywood West July 29 She'd been lyin' there for two or three weeks The neighbors said they never heard a squeak For hungry eyes that couid not speak Said even little doggie's have got to eat She was winner The became the doggie's dinner She never meant that much to me (But now I see) Oh poor Mary Mary Provost was a movie queen Mysterious angel of the silent screen And run like the wind the nation's young men steam When Mary crossed the silent screen Oh she came out west from New York But when the talkies came Mary just couldn't cope Her public said Mary take a walk All the way back to New York Those twin balms didn't help her sleep As her nights grew long and her days grew bleak It's all downhill once you've passed your peak Mary got ready for that last big sleep The cops came in and they looked around Throwing up everywhere over what they found The handywork of Mary's little dachshund That hungry little dachshund Poor Mary, poor Mary, poor poor Mary Poor Mary",
