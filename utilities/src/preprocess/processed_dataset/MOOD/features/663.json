    "cleaned_text": "Trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro You have no word Trip, trip to a dream dragon Hide your wings in a ghost tower Sails crackiling at ev'ry plate we break Cracked by scattered needles Little minute gong Coughs and clears his throat Madam you see before you stand Hey ho, never be still The old original favourite gran Grasshoppers green herbarian band And the tune they play in us confide... So trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro' You have no word Please leave us here Close our eyes to the octopus ride! Isn't it good to be lost in the wood Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood Twenty even less to me than I thought With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed... Well, the madcap laughed at the man on the border Hey ho, huff the talbot Cheetah he cried shouted kangaroo So through their tree they cried Please leave us here Close our eyes to the octopus ride! The madcap laughed at the man on the border Hey ho, huff the talbot The winds they blew and the leaves did wag And they'll never put me in their bag The seas will reach and always see So high you go, so low you creep The winds it blows in tropical heat The drones they throng on mossy seats The squeaking door will always creep Two up, two down we'll never meet So merrily trip for good my side Please leave us here Close our eyes to the octopus ride!",
