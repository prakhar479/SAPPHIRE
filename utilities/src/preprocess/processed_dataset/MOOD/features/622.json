    "cleaned_text": "Grandma got run over by a reindeer, Walking home from our house Christmas Eve, You can say there's no such thing as Santa, But as for me and Grampa, we believe. She'd been drinkin too much egg-nog, And we'd begged her not to go, But she'd forgot her medication And she staggered out the door into the snow. When we found her Christmas morning, At the scene of the attack, She had hoof prints on her forehead, And incriminating Claus marks on her back. Grandma got run over by a reindeer, Walking home from our house Christmas Eve, You can say there's no such thing as Santa, But as for me and Grampa, we believe. Now we're all so proud of Grampa, He's been taking this so well, See him in there watchin football, Drinkin' beer and playing cards with cousin Mel. It's not Christmas without Grandma, All the family's dressed in black, And we just can't help but wonder, Should we open up her gifts or send them back? (SEND THEM BACK!) Grandma got run over by a reindeer, Walking home from our house Christmas Eve, You can say there's no such thing as Santa, But as for me and Grampa, we believe. Now the goose is on the table, And the pudding made of fig, (ahh) And the blue and silver candles That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig. I've warned all my friends and neigbors, \"Better watch out for yourselves\", They should never give a license To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves. Grandma got run over by a reindeer, Walking home from our house Christmas Eve, You can say there's no such thing as Santa, But as for me and Grampa, we believe. (SING IT GRAMPA!) Grandma got run over by a reindeer, Walking home from our house Christmas Eve, You can say there's no such thing as Santa, But as for me and Grampa, we believe.",
