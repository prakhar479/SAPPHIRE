    "cleaned_text": "Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone But in my mind I know they will still live on and on But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume? It isn't easy, but I'll try If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love' The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return? If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir, With Love' [Instrumental Interlude to end]",
