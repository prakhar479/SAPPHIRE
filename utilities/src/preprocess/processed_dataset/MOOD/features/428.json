    "cleaned_text": "I find you in the morning After dreams of distant signs You pour yourself over me Like the sun through the blinds You lift me up And get me out Keep me walking But never shout Hold the secret close I hear you say You know the way It throws about It takes you in And spits you out It spits you out When you desire To conquer it To feel you're higher To follow it You must be clean With mistakes That you do mean Move the heart Switch the pace Look for what seems out of place On and on it goes Calling like a distant wind Through the zero hour we'll walk Cut the thick and break the thin No sound to break no moment clear When all the doubts are crystal clear Crashing hard into the secret wind You know the way It twists and turns Changing color Spinning yarns You know the way It leaves you dry It cuts you up It takes you high You know the way It's painted gold Is it honey Is it gold You know the way It throws about It takes you in And spits you out You know the way It throws about It takes you in And spits you out It spits you out When you desire To conquer it To feel you're higher To follow it You must be clean With mistakes That you do mean Move the heart Switch the pace Look for what Seems out of place It's o.k. It goes this way The line is thin It twists away Cuts you up It throws about Keep me walking But never shout.",
