(Chorus) You got yer Dead skunk in the middle of the road, Dead skunk in the middle of the road, Dead skunk in the middle of the road, Stinkin' to high heaven! Take a whiff on me that ain't no rose! Roll up yer window and hold yer nose, You don't have to look and you don't have to see, 'Cause you can feel it in your olfactory, (Repeat Chorus) Yeah you got yer dead cat and you got yer dead dog, On a moonlight night you got yer dead toad frog Got yer dead rabbit and yer dead raccoon, The blood and the guts they're gonna make you swoon! You got yer dead skunk, in the middle, Dead skunk in the middle of the road. Dead skunk in the middle of the road, Stinkin' to high heaven. C'mon stink! (Fiddle break) You got it, It's dead, it's in the middle, Dead skunk in the middle! Dead skunk in the middle of the road, Stinkin' to high heaven! All over the road, technicolor man! Oh, you got pollution. It's dead, it's in the middle, And it's stinkin' to high, high heaven! (Fiddle fadeout)",
