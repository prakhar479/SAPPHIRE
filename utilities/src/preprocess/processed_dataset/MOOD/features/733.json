And I can't sail my yacht, He's taken everything I got, All I've got's this sunny afternoon. Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze. I gotta big fat mama trying to break me. And I love to live so pleasantly, Live this life of luxury, Lazing on a sunny afternoon. In a summertime In a summertime In a summertime My girlfriend's run off with my car, And gone back to her ma and pa, Telling tails of drunkenness and cruelty. Now I'm sitting here, Sipping at my ice cold beer, Lazing on a sunny afternoon. Help me, help me, help me sail away, Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay. 'Cause I love to live so pleasantly, Live this life of luxury, Lazing on a sunny afternoon. In a summertime In a summertime In a summertime Ah, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze. I gotta big fat mama trying to break me. And I love to live so pleasantly, Live this life of luxury, Lazing on a sunny afternoon. In a summertime In a summertime In a summertime...",
