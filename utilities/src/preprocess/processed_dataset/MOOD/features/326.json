Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings These are a few of my favorite things! Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eye lashes Silver white winters that melt into springs These are a few of my favorite things! When the dog bites, when the bee stings When I'm feeling sad, I simply remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad!
