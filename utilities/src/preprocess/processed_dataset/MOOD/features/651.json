    "cleaned_text": "1 2 1 2 3 Yeah I was working part time in a five-and-dime My boss was Mr. McGee He told me several times that he didn't like my kind Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing But different than the day before That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her She walked in through the out door, out door She wore a Raspberry beret The kind U find in a second hand store Raspberry beret And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more Raspberry beret I think I love her Built like she was She had the nerve 2 ask me If I planned 2 do her any harm So, look here I put her on the back of my bike And-a we went riding Down by old man Johnson's farm I said now, overcast days never turned me on But something about the clouds and her mixed She wasn't 2 bright But I could tell when she kissed me She knew how 2 get her kicks She wore a Raspberry beret The kind U find in a second hand store Raspberry beret And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more Raspberry beret I think I love her The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof And the horses wonder who U are Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees U feel like a movie star Listen They say the first time ain't the greatest But I tell ya If I had the chance 2 do it all again I wouldn't change a stroke Cause baby I'm the most With a girl as fine as she was then (Raspberry beret) The kind U find (The kind U find) The kind U find (In a second hand store) Oh no no (Raspberry beret) (And if it was warm) Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more) Yeah (Raspberry beret) I think I... I think I... I think I love her (Raspberry beret) No No No No No No (The kind U find) (In a second hand store) (Raspberry beret) Tell me Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she) (Wouldn't wear much more) (Raspberry beret) I think I love...",
