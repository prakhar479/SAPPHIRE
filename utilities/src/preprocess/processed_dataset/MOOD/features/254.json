I can't be sure Of the scene, as she turns We are strange, in our worlds But we are young, we get by Can't go mad, ain't got time Sleep around if we like But we're alright Got some cash, bought some wheels Took it out, through some fields Lost controls, hit a wall But we're alright [Chorus:] But we are young, we run green Keep our teeth nice and clean See our friends, see the sights Feels alright [Chorus:] But we are young, we run green Keep our teeth nice and clean See our friends, see the sights Feels alright",
