    "cleaned_text": "Outside another yellow moon Has punched a hole in the nighttime, yes I climb through the window and down to the street I'm shining like a new dime The downtown trains are full with all of those Brooklyn girls They try so hard to break out of their little worlds Well you wave your hand and they scatter like crows They have nothing that will ever capture your heart They're just thorns without the rose Be careful of them in the dark Oh, if I was the one you chose to be your only one Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now Will I see you tonight on a downtown train Every night it's just the same, you leave me lonely now I know your window and I know it's late I know your stairs and your doorway I walk down your street and past your gate I stand by the light at the four-way You watch them as they fall, oh baby, they all have heart attacks They stay at the carnival, but they'll never win you back Will I see you tonight on a downtown train Where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby Will I see you tonight on a downtown train All of my dreams they fall like rain, oh baby on a downtown train Will I see you tonight on a downtown train Where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby Will I see you tonight on a downtown train All of my dreams just fall like rain, all on a downtown train All on a downtown train, all on a downtown train All on a downtown train, a downtown train",
