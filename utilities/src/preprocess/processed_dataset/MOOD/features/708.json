    "cleaned_text": "Shirley, it's quite exciting to be sleeping here in this new room Shirley, you're my reason to get out of bed before noon Shirley, you know when we sat out on the fire escape talking Shirley, what did you say about running before we were walking Sometimes when we're as close as this It's like we're in a dream How can you lie there and think of England When you don't even know who's in the team Shirley, your sexual politics have left me all of a muddle Shirley, we are joined in the ideological cuddle I'm celebrating my love for you With a pint of beer and a new tattoo And if you haven't noticed yet I'm more impressionable when my cement is wet Politics and pregnancy Are debated as we empty our glasses And how I love those evening classes Shirley, you really know how to make a young man angry Shirley, can we get through the night without mentioning family The people from your church agree It's not much of a career Trying the handles of parked cars Whoops, there goes another year Whoops, there goes another pint of beer Here we are in our summer years Living on icecream and chocolate kisses Would the leaves fall from the trees If I was your old man and you were my missus Shirley, give my greetings to the new brunette",
