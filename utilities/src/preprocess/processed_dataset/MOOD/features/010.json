    "cleaned_text": "It was christmas eve babe In the drunk tank An old man said to me, wont see another one And then he sang a song The rare old mountain dew I turned my face away And dreamed about you Got on a lucky one Came in eighteen to one Ive got a feeling This years for me and you So happy christmas I love you baby I can see a better time When all our dreams come true Theyve got cars big as bars Theyve got rivers of gold But the wind goes right through you Its no place for the old When you first took my hand On a cold christmas eve You promised me Broadway was waiting for me You were handsome You were pretty Queen of new york city When the band finished playing They howled out for more Sinatra was swinging, All the drunks they were singing We kissed on a corner Then danced through the night The boys of the nypd choir Were singing galway bay And the bells were ringing out For christmas day Youre a bum Youre a punk Youre an old slut on junk Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed You scumbag, you maggot You cheap lousy faggot Happy christmas your arse I pray God its our last I could have been someone Well so could anyone You took my dreams from me When I first found you I kept them with me babe I put them with my own Cant make it all alone Ive built my dreams around you",
