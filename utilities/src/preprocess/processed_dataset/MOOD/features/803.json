    "cleaned_text": "Whatever Dre just let it run Ah-yo turn the beat up a little bit Ah-yo this song is for anyone Fuck it just shut up and listen Ah-yo I sit back with this pack of zigzags And this bag of this weed It gives me the shit needed to be The most meanest MC on this on this earth 'Cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse And just blurt this bezerk and bizarre shit that works And it sells and it helps in its self To relieve all this tension dispensing me Sentence is getting it, stress has been eating me recently Off my chest and I rest to get peacefully But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone When you freaks see me out in the streets when I'm eating or feedin' my daughter To not come and speak to me I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuck anything I'm not Mr. NSYNC and I'm not what your friends think I'm not Mr. Friendly I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe I'm tired of all you - I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be It's just me [Chorus] And I am Whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am Whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am I don't know it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered With all of this nonsense it's constant And \"oh it's his lyrical content!\" The song \"Guilty Conscience\" has gotten such rotten responses And all of this controversy circles me And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me So I point one back at 'em But not the index or the pinky or the ring or the thumb It's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 'Cause they full of shit too When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school And they blame it on Marilyn - and the heroin Where were the parents at? And look at where it's at middle America Now it's a tragedy Now it's so sad to see An upper class city having this happening Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned [Chorus] I'm so sick and tired of being admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And drop from my label and stop with the fables I'm not gonna be able to top on \"my name is\" And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations They cop me rotation at Rock 'N' Roll stations And I just do not have the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls So they always keep asking the same fucking questions What school did I go to? What hood I grew up in? The why? The who, what? When and where and the how? 'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out You've been driving me crazy, I can't take it I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit And I'm thankful for every fan that I get But I can't take a shit in the bathroom Without someone standing by it No I won't sign your autograph You can call me an asshole I'm glad cause [Chorus]",
