    "cleaned_text": "Dearly beloved We are gathered here today to get through this thing called life Electric word life, it means 4ever and that's a mighty long time But I'm here 2 tell U there's somethin' else, The afterworld A world of never ending happiness U can always see the sun, day or night So when U call up that shrink in Beverly Hills U know the one - Dr. Everything'll Be Alright Instead of asking him how much of your time is left Ask him how much of your mind, baby Cuz in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld In this life U're on your own And if de-elevator tries 2 bring U down, go crazy Punch a higher floor! If U don't like the world U're living in Take a look around U, at least U got friends U see, I called my old lady 4 a friendly word She just picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor Ahh! Ahh! was all I heard CHORUS: Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down? Oh no, let's go! Let's go crazy, let's get nuts Let's look 4 the purple banana till they put us in the truck Let's go! We're all excited, but we don't know why Maybe it's cuz we're all gonna die And when we do, what's it all 4? U better live now before the grim reaper Come knockin' on your door Tell me... CHORUS Come on, baby Let's get nuts! Yeah (Crazy) Let's go crazy Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down? Oh no, let's go crazy! (Go crazy!) I said let's go crazy! (Go crazy!) Let's go! (Let's go!) Go! (Let's go!) Dr. Everything'll Be Alright will make everything go wrong Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill Hang tough children, He's coming! He's coming! Coming! Take me away!",
