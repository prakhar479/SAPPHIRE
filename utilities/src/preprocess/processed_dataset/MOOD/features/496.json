At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes. Amanda, light of my life. Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife. Amanda, light of my life. Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife. It's a measure of people who don't understand, The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band. I got my first guitar when I was fourteen, Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans. Amanda, light of my life. Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife. Amanda, light of my life. Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.",
