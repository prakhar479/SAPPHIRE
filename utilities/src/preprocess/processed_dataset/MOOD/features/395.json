    "cleaned_text": "Mrs. Molly Jenkins sells her wares in town Saturdays in the evening when the farmhands come around And she sows all their names in her gown Ah, but is she happy no no no She wants a better home and a better kind of life But how is she going to get the things she wants, the things she needs as some poor wretch of a farmer's wife He trades the milk for booze And Molly wants new shoes And as she snuggles down With some stranger in some back of the barroom bed It's much too dark to the see the stranger So she thinks of shoes instead Old Man Horace Jenkins stays at home to tend to his schemes Sends for pictures of black stockings on paper legs with paper seams and he drinks until he drowns in his dreams Ah, but is he happy? No, no, no He wants to be reborn to lead the pious life But how's he going to going shed his boozy dreams when he has to bear the cross of a wicked wife She claims to visit shows And he pretends that's where she goes And as he snuggles down to his reading in a half-filled marriage bed He's so ashamed of what he's reading that he gets blind drunk instead Sunday breakfast with the Jenkins They break the bread and cannot speak She reads the rustling of his paper He reads the way her new shoes squeak And pray God to survive another week Ah, but are they happy You'd be surprised between the bed and the booze and the shoes They suffer least that suffer what they choose",
