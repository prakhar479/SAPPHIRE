By the summer it was healing, We had said goodbye. All the years we'd spent with feeling Ended with a cry, Babe, ended with a cry, Babe, ended with a cry. I tried so hard to stand As I stumbled and fell to the ground. So hard to laugh as I fumbled And reached for the love I found, Knowin' it was gone. If I never lived without you, Now you know I'd die. If I never said I loved you, Now you know I'd try, Babe, now you know I'd try. Babe, now you know I'd try, Babe.",
