What I do ain't make-believe People say I sit and try But when it comes to being De La It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I Now you tease my Plug One style And my Plug One spectacles You say Plug One and Two are hippies No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull Always pushing that we've formed an image There's no need to lie When it comes to being Plug One It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I Proud, I'm proud of what I am Poems I speak are Plug Two type Please oh please let Plug Two be Himself, not what you read or write Right is wrong when hype is written On the Soul, De La that is, Style is surely our own thing Not the false disguise of showbiz De La Soul is from the soul And this fact I can't deny Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie And from me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I Glory, glory hallelujah Glory for Plugs One and Two But that glory's been denied By kizids and dookie eyes People think they dis my person By stating I'm darkly pack I know this so I point at Q-Tip And he states, 'Black is Black' Mirror mirror on the wall, Shovel chestnuts in my path Please keep on up with the nuts So I don't get in aftermath But if I do I'll calmly punch them In the fourth day of July 'Cause they tried to mess with Third degree, that's me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I",
