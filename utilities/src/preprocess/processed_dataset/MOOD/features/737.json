    "cleaned_text": "Anthony walked to his death because he thought he'd never feel this way again If he goes back to the house then things would go from bad to worse, what could he do? He wants to remember things exactly as he left them on that Wednesday And if there is something else beyond, he isn't scared because It's bound to be less boring than today It's bound to be less boring than tomorrow Hilary walked to her death because she couldn't think of anything to say Everybody thought that she was boring, so they never listened anyway Nobody was really saying anything of interest, she fell asleep She was into S&M and bible studies Not everyone's cup of tea she would admit to me Her cup of tea, she would admit to no one Her cup of tea, she would admit to me Oh but her cup of tea, she would admit to no one Hilary went to the Catholic Church because she wanted information The vicar, or whatever, took her to one side and gave her confirmation Saint Theresa's calling her, the church up on the hill is looking lovely But it doesn't interest, the only things she wants to know is How and why and when and where to go How and why and when and where to follow How and why and when and where to go How and why and when and where to follow But if you are feeling sinister Go off and see a minister He'll try in vain to take away the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever When she got back, her spirituality was thrown into confusion So she got a special deal on renting From the man at Rediffusion \"Look at me! I'm on TV It makes up for the shortcomings of being poor Now I'm in a million pieces\", picked up for deliberation By the people listening at home By the people watching on the telly By the people listening at home By the people watching on the telly But if you are feeling sinister Go off and see a minister Chances are you'll probably feel better If you stayed and played with yourself",
