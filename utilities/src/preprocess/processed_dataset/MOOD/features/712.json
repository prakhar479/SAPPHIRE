    "cleaned_text": "I changed my name in search of fame To find the Midas touch Oh I wish I'd never wanted then What I want now twice as much We crossed the mighty oceans And we had a few divides But we never crossed emotion For we felt too much inside You know all the tales we tell You know the band so well Still I feel, somehow, we let you down We went off somewhere on the way And now I see we have to pay The rock'n'roll circus is in town Buffin lost his child-like dreams And Mick lost his guitar And Verden grew a line or two And Overend's just a rock'n'roll star Behind these shades the visions fade As I learn a thing or two Oh but if I had my time again You all know just what I'd do Rock'n'roll's a loser's game It mesmerises and I can't explain The reasons for the sights and for the sounds We went off somewhere on the way And now I see we have to pay The rock'n'roll circus is in town So Rock'n'roll's a loser's game It mesmerises and I can't explain The reasons for the sights and for the sounds The greasepaint still sticks to my face So what the hell, I can't erase The rock'n'roll feeling from my mind From my mind?.from my mind?.from my mind From my miiiiiind?.from my miiiiind?.from my miiiiiiiiind From my miiiiiiiiiiiind",
