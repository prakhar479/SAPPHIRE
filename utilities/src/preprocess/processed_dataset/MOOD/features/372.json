    "cleaned_text": "Fox in the snow, where do you go To find something you can eat? Cause the word out on the street is you are starving Don't let yourself grow hungry now Don't let yourself grow cold Fox in the snow Girl in the snow, where will you go To find someone that will do? To tell someone all the truth before it kills you They listen to your crazy laugh Before you hang a right And disappear from sight What do they know anyway? You'll read it in a book What do they know anyway? You'll read it in a book tonight Boy on the bike, what are you like As you cycle round the town? You're going up, you're going down You're going nowhere It's not as if they're paying you It's not as if it's fun At least not anymore When your legs are black and blue It's time to take a break When your legs are black and blue It's time to take a holiday Kid in the snow, way to go It only happens once a year It only happens once a lifetime Make the most of it Second just to being born Second to dying to What else could you do?",
