    "cleaned_text": "There's only one way of life And that's your own your own your own My father when I was younger Took me up on to the hill That looks down on the city smog And above the factory spill He said now this is where I come When I wanted to be free but he never was in his lifetime But these words stuck with me hey And so I ran from all of this And I climbed that highest hill I looked down on to my life Above the factory spill I looked down onto my life As the family disgrace Then all my friends on the starting line Their wages off to chase Yes and all my friends and all their jobs All the bloody waste CHORUS Well well when I grew up, learned to love and laugh Circled A's on the underpass The noise we thought would never stop Died a death when the punks grew up And we choked on all our dreams We resalled all our fears Running through the heartless concrete streets Chasing our ideas Run And all the problems of the world Won't be solved by this guitar And they won't stop coming either By the life I've had so far And the bright lights of my home town Won't be getting any dimmer Though their calling has receded Like some old distant singer And they don't look so appealing To the eyes of this poor sinner CHORUS",
