    "cleaned_text": "Do you remember back in old L.A. (Oh, oh, oh) When everybody drove a Chevrolet (Oh, oh, oh) Whatever happened to the boy next door The sun-tanned, crew-cut, All-American male? Remember dancing at the high school hop? The dress I ruined with the soda pop? I didn't recognize the girl next door With beat up sneakers and a pony tail Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand Give me something that I can remember Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand From July to the end of September Surfin' was fun we'd be out in the sun every day Ooooh, I never thought that it could end Ooooh, and I was everybody's friend Long hot days Blue sea haze Jukebox plays But now it's fading away [break] We couldn't wait for graduation day (Oh, oh, oh) We took the car and drove to San Jose (Oh, oh, oh) That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring I guess you don't remember anything Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand Give me something that I can remember Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand From July til the end of September Surfin' was fun we'd be out in the sun every day Ahhh,ahhh,ahhh Ahhh,ahhh,ahhh Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand Give me something that I can remember Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand From July til the end of September Surfin' was fun we'd be out in the sun every day",
