    "cleaned_text": "When I was seventeen, it was a very good year It was a very good year for small town girls And soft summer nights We'd hide from the lights On the village green When I was seventeen When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year It was a very good year for city girls Who lived up the stairs With perfumed hair That came undone When I was twenty-one When I was thirty-five, it was a very good year It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls Of independent means We'd ride in limousines Their chauffeurs would drive When I was thirty-five But now the days are short, I'm in the autumn of my years And I think of my life as vintage wine From fine old kegs From the brim to the dregs It poured sweet and clear It was a very good year",
