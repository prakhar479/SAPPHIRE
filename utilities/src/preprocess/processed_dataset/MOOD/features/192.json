    "cleaned_text": "Here comes my guy walking down the street Look how he walks with a dancing beat Thick wavy hair, a little too long All day long he's singing his song And when I see him in the street My heart takes a leap and skips a beat Gonna walk right up to him Give him a great big kiss Tell him that I love him Tell him that I care Tell him that I'll always be there (Spoken) Well what color are his eyes? I don't know he's always wearing shades Is he tall? Well, I've got to look up Yeah? Well I hear he's bad MM, he's good bad, but he's not evil Tell me more, tell me more Big bulky sweaters to match his eyes Dirty fingernails Oh boy what a prize Tight tapered pants, high button shoes He's always looking like he's got the blues And when I see him in the street My heart takes a leap and skips a beat Gonna walk right up to him Give him a great big kiss Tell him that I love him Tell him that I care Tell him that I'll always be there",
