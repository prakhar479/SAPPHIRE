(anytime) Recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?) To avoid complications, she never kept the same address In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness Met a man from China went down to Geisha Minah Then again incidentally if you're that way inclined Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally) For cars she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine Dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime) Recommended at the price, Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?) Drop of a hat she's as willing as a playful as a pussy cat Then momentarily out of action, temporarily out of gas To absolutely drive you wild, wild She's out to get you She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime) Recommended at the price, insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)",
