Poor poor pitiful me Poor poor pitiful me These young girls won't let me be Lord have mercy on me Woe, is me Well O met a girl at the rainbow bar She asked me if i'd beat her and she took me back to the Hyatt house I don't want to talk about it Poor poor pitiful me whoo! Poor poor pitiful me Hot little mamma(faint) Poor poor pitiful me Whoo hoo! Poor pitiful me (last verse only live) (Well, I met a girl from the Vieux Carre' Down in Yokahama She picked me up and she throwed me down I said, \"Please don't hurt me, Mama\")",
