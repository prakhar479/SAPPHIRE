Can the child within my heart rise above? Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides? Can I handle the seasons of my life? I don't know Well, I've been afraid of changin' 'cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder Even children get older And I'm getting older too Oh, take my love, take it down Climb a mountain and turn around And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills Well the landslide will bring it down And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills Well the landslide will bring it down The landslide will bring it down",
