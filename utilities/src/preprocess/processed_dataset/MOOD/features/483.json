That was a good drum break Pick yourself up off the side of the road With your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones Members only, hyponotizers Move through the room like ambulance drivers Shine your shoes with your microphone blues Hirsutes with your parachute flutes Passing the dutchie from coast to coast Let the man Gary Wilson rock the most Where it's at I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at I got two turntables and a microphone What about those who swing both ways: AC-DC's Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Where it's at I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at I got two turntables and a microphone Oh, dear me. Make Out City is a two-horse town That's beautiful, Dad Get my microphone There's a destination a little up the road From the habitations and the towns we know A place we saw the lights turn low Jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts Two turntables and a microphone Bottles and cans and just clap your hands and just clap your hands Where it's at I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at I got two turntables and a microphone I got plastic on my mind Telephone plastic baby",
