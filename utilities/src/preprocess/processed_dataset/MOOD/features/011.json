Up in Harlem ev'ry Saturday night When the highbrows get together its just too tight They all congregates at an all night strut And what they do is tut-tut-tut Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town Gets full of corn and starts breakin' 'em down Just at the break of day You can hear old Hannah say Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer Send me 'gain, I don't care I feel just like I wanna clown Give the piano player a drink Because he's bringin' me down! He's gotta rhythm, Y-e-e-a-a-h! When he stomps his feet He sends me right off to sleep Check all your razors and your guns We gonna be 'rested when the wagon comes I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer Send me 'cause I don't care Play me 'cause I don't care Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer Send me 'gain, I don't care I feel just like I wanna clown Give the piano player a drink Because he's bringin' me down He's got rhythm, Y-e-e-a-a-h! When he stomps his feet He sends me right off to sleep Check all your razors and your guns Do the shim-sham-shimmy 'til the risin' sun Give me a reefer and a gang o' gin Play me 'cause I'm in my sin Play me 'cause I'm full of gin",
