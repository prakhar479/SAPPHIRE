    "cleaned_text": "Well in 1941 a happy father had a son And by 1944 the father walked right out the door And in '45 the mom and son were still alive But who could tell in '46 if the two were to survive Well the years were passing quickly, but not fast enough for him So he closed his eyes through '55, then he opened them up again When he looked around he saw a clown and the clown seemed very gay And he set that night to join that circus clown and run away Well he followed every railroad track and every highway sign And he had a girl in each new town and the towns he left behind And the open road was the only road he knew But the color of his dreams was slowly turning into blue Then he met a girl, the kind of girl he wanted all his life She was soft and kind and good to him, so he took her for his wife And they got a house not far from town and in a little while The girl had seen the doctor and she came home with a smile Now in 1961 a happy father had a son And by 1964 the father walked right out the door And in '65 the mom and son were still around But what will happen to the boy when the circus comes to town",
