    "cleaned_text": "Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills Me and my old pappy had a hand in a still We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin' Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'. Chorus: Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too Searchin' for the place where he made his brew They were looking, tryin to book him, But my pappy kept a-cookin' Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'. --- Instrumental --- Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew I took a little sip and right away I knew As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue Lightnin' started flashin' and thunder started crashin' Shhhoooh . . . white lightnin'. Chorus: Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too Searchin' for the place where he made his brew They were looking, tryin to book him, But my pappy kept a-cookin' Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'. --- Instrumental --- Well, a city slicker came and he said I'm tough I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff He took one s-slug and drank it right down And I heard him a moaning as he hit the ground Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin' Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'. Chorus: Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too Searchin' for the place where he made his brew They were looking, tryin to book him, But my pappy kept a-cookin' Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'... Please Note: In live version the 2nd verse is reversed with the 3rd verse. In another version the word s-s-ip in used in place of the word s-slug found in 3rd verse.",
