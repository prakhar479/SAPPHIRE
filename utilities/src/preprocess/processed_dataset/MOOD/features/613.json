    "cleaned_text": "Well I saw the thing comin' out of the sky It had the one long horn, one big eye I commenced to shakin' and I said \"ooh-eee\" It looks like a purple eater to me It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater (One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater) A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater Sure looks strange to me (One eye?) Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me I heard him say in a voice so gruff I wouldn't eat you cuz you're so tough It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater One-eyed, one-horned flyin' purple people eater One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater Sure looks strange to me (One horn?) I said Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line He said it's eatin' purple people and it sure is fine But that's not the reason that I came to land I wanna get a job in a rock and roll band Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater (We wear short shorts) Flyin' purple people eater Sure looks strange to me And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground He started to rock, really rockin' around It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune Sing a boop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater I like short shorts Flyin' little people eater Sure looks strange to me (Purple People?) And then he went on his way, and then what do ya know I saw him last night on a TV show He was blowing it out, a'really knockin' em dead Playin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head [Clarinet solo] Tequila",
