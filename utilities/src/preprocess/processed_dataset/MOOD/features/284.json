Or better still, just stop the train, Cause I wanna look around. Hey porter! Hey porter! What time did ya say? How much longer will it be till I can See the light of day? When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer To ring his bell? And ask everybody that ain't asleep To stand right up and yell. Hey porter! Hey porter! It's getting light outside. This old train is puffin' smoke, And I have to strain my eyes. But ask that engineer if he will Blow his whistle please. Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves And I feel that Southern breeze. Hey porter! Hey porter! Please get my bags for me. I need nobody to tell me now That we're in Tennessee. Go tell that engineer to make that Lonesome whistle scream, We're not so far from home So take it easy on the steam. Hey porter! Hey porter! Please open up the door. When they stop the train I'm gonna get off first Cause I can't wait no more. Tell that engineer I said thanks alot, And I didn't mind the fare. I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil And breathe that Southern air.",
