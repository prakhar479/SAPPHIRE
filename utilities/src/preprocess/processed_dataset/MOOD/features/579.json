Didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters Too late, my time has come, sends shivers down my spine Body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama oooh (any way the wind blows) I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me Galileo (Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo figaro (Magnifico) But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family Spare him his life from this monstrosity Easy come easy go, will you let me go Bismillah! No, we will not let you go, let him go Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go Will not let you go, let me go Will not let you go let me go No, no, no, no, no, no, no Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh baby, can't do this to me baby Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me Any way the wind blows....",
