You weren't there for me 'Cause I'm not who I should be for you You've got a record and a past Guess that's what makes me the ass I should've known, I should've cared How could I have been so unprepared? Now where does the good boy go to hide away, hide the pain? 'Cause you won't see me cry when I'm done What is it that you want from me, want from me? What is it that you want from me, want from me? I want you to feel, I want you to feel I want you to feel, I want you to feel I'm a feather in the wind I'm carried away by all that you say Sitting on thin air I'm a loss to my friends Too unpersuaded by all they're saying And you can't pretend to care, yeah Yeah, I was reckless in the past I was see-through just like glass Did all I could to make this last So how could you be such an ass? I know where the good boys go to hide the pain, hide the pain But that don't mean I die when you don't What is it that you want from me, want from me? What is it that you want from me, want from me? I want you to feel, I want you to feel I want you to feel, I want you to feel What is it that you want from me, want from me? What is it that you want from me, want from me? I want you to feel, I want you to feel I want you to feel, I want you to feel Good boys go to hide the pain, hide the pain 'Cause you won't see me cry when I'm done I know where the good boys go to hide the pain, hide the pain But that don't mean I die when you don't",
