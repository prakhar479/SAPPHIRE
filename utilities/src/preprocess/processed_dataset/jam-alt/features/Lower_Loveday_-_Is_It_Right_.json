I've been thinking about you lately (lately) That's a massive understatement, baby I can't stop thinking about you all day and all night Oh, but is it right? Finally figured it out, I got my head around it Although I know I've got to get myself out of this habit Of falling for someone who's out of reach, it's unrealistic My dream won't become a reality, but was it meant to be? I've been thinking about you lately (lately) That's a massive understatement, baby 'Cause I'm thinking about you all day and all night Oh, but is it right? I don't know but I, I know how it feels to me Maybe you're just playing games, a game I don't wanna play I don't know but I, I know how it feels to me Maybe you're just playing games, a game I don't wanna play I've been thinking about you lately (lately) That's a massive understatement, baby 'Cause I'm thinking about you all day and all night Oh, but is it right?
