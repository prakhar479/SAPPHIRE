Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do, I take for granted that you're always there, I take for granted that you just don't care, Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through. It's important to me That you know you are free, 'Cause I never want to make you change for me. Think of me, You know that I'd be with you if I could I'll come around to see you once in a while or if I ever need a reason to smile And spend the night if you think I should.
