I think I'll let you down (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl) And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat) Because I told you before (Good day sunshine) Oh, you can't do that (Day tripper, yeah!) Paperback writer, yeah! Everybody's green 'Cos I'm the one who stole your love But if it's seen Me talking that way They'd laugh in my face So, please listen to me If you want to stay mine (Would you like to know a secret?) I can't help my feelings I'd go out of my mind I'm gonna let you down (Yes, yes, I'm gonna leave you flat) And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat) Because I told you before I can't believe in yesterday My babe doesn't buy me presents",
