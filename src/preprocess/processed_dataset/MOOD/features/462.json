    "cleaned_text": "This is the day of the expanding man That shape is my shade There where I used to stand It seems like only yesterday I gazed through the glass At ramblers, wild gamblers That's all in the past You call me a fool You say it's a crazy scheme This one's for real I already bought the dream So useless to ask me why Throw a kiss and say goodbye I'll make it this time I'm ready to cross that fine line [Chorus] I'll learn to work the saxophone I play just what I feel Drink Scotch whiskey all night long And die behind the wheel They got a name for the winners in the world And I want a name when I lose They call Alabama the Crimson Tide Call me Deacon Blues My back to the wall A victim of laughing chance This is for me The essence of true romance Sharing the things we know and love With those of my kind Libations Sensations That stagger the mind I crawl like a viper Through these suburban streets Make love to these women Languid and bittersweet I'll rise when the sun goes down Cover every game in town A world of my own I'll make it my home sweet home [Chorus] This is the night of the expanding man I take one last drag As I approach the stand I cried when I wrote this song Sue me if I play too long This brother is free I'll be what I want to be",
