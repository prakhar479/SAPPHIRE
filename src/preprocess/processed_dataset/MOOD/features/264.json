(oh, oh) She loved me so long and she loved me so hard I finally passed out in her front yard (whoo!) It wasn't wine that I had too much of It was a double shot of my baby's love Chorus: Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah A potion that I had too much of It was a double shot of my baby's love [repeat intro] Verse 2: It was such a thrill it was hurtin' me (ooh!) I was sufferin' in ecstasy She had me turnin' flips and-a shoutin' out loud (yah-hah!) A sip of her love and I was walkin' one a cloud One night a week is-a plenty enough It's a good thing for me they don't bottle that stuff [pop!] Well, my heart begins to fly like a dove When I take a double shot of my baby's love [repeat chorus] Coda [repeat to fade over trash organ riff from intro]: Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah",
