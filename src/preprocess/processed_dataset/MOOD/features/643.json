    "cleaned_text": "Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars? I don't know if you knew that Oh we'd stay up late playing cards Henri Winterman Cigars Though she never told me her name I still love you, Girl From Mars Sitting in our dreamy daze by the water's edge On a cool summer night Fireflies and the stars in the sky Gentle glowing light From your cigarette The breeze blowing softly on my face Reminds me of something else Something that in my memory has been misplaced Suddenly all comes back And as I look to the stars I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars I don't know if you knew that Oh we'd stay up late playing cards Henri Winterman Cigars Though she never told me her name I still love you, Girl From Mars Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand Electricity in the air Twisting all through the night on the terrace Now that summer's here I know that you are almost in love with me I can see it in your eyes Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight And it almost blows my mind And as I look to the stars I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars I don't know if you knew that Oh we'd stay up late playing cards Henri Winterman Cigars Though she never told me her name I still love you, Girl From Mars Today I sleep in the chair by the window It felt as if you'd returned I thought that you were standing over me When I woke there was no-one there I still love you, Girl From... MARS! Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars? I don't know if you knew that Oh we'd stay up late playing cards Henri Winterman Cigars Though she never told me her name Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars? I don't know if you knew that Oh we'd stay up late playing cards Henri Winterman Cigars And I still dream of you I still love you, Girl From Mars",
