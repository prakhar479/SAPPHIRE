Every single day Every word you say Every game you play Every night you stay I'll be watching you. Oh can't you see You belong to me? How my poor heart aches with every step you take. Every move you make Every vow you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be watching you. Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace. I dream at night, I can only see your face. I look around but it's you I can't replace. I keep crying baby, baby please.................. Every move you make Every vow you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be watching you. Every move you make Every vow you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be watching you.......",
