Sooner or later you hit the deck you get found out Save it for later don't run away and let me down, you let me down. Black air and seven seas all rotten through But what can you do? I don't know how I'm meant to act with all of you lot Sometimes I don't try I just now now now now now now now now now now now Now now now now now now now now now now now Soomer or later your legs give way, you hit the ground Save it for later don't run away and let me down. Sooner or later you hit the deck you get found out Save it for later don't run away and let me down You runaway runaway and let me down. Two dozen other stupid reasons Why we should suffer for this Don't bother trying to explain them Just hold my hand while I come to a decision on it. Sooner or later your legs give way, you hit the ground Save it Fellator, don't run away and let me down.
