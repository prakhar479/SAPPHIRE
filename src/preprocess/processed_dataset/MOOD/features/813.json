    "cleaned_text": "5 AM Friday morning Thursday night Far from sleep I'm still up and driving Can't go home obviously So I'll just change direction 'Cause they'll soon know where I live And I wanna live Got a full tank and some chips It was me and a gun and a man on my back And I sang 'Holy Holy' as he buttoned down his pants You can laugh It's kinda funny The things you think at times like these Like I haven't seen Barbados So I must get out of this Yes, I wore a slinky red thing Does that mean I should spread For you Your friends Your father Mr. Ed It's me and a gun and a man on my back But I haven't seen Barbados So I must get out of this I know what this means Me and Jesus a few years back Used to hang And he said \"it's your choice, babe Just remember I don't think you'll be back In 3 days time So you choose well\" Tell me what's right Is it my right To be on my stomach Of Fred's Seville It's me and a gun and a man on my back But I haven't seen Barbados So I must get out of this And do you know Carolina Where the biscuits are soft and sweet These things that go through your head When there's a man on your back And you're pushed flat on your stomach It's not a classic Cadillac It's me and a gun and a man on my back And I haven't seen Barbados So I must get out of this I haven't seen Barbados So I must get out of this",
