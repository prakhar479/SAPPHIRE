I've been singing with my band, across the wire across the land I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way But their beauty and their style, went kind of smooth after a while Take me to them dirty ladies every time Oh won't you take me home tonight? Oh down beside your red firelight Oh and you give it all you got Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round Hey listen here Now your mortgages and homes, I got stiffness in the bones Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you) Oh but I still get my pleasure, still got my greatest treasure Heap big woman you gonna make a big man out of me Now get this... Oh you gonna take me home tonight (please) Oh down beside your red firelight, Oh you gonna let it all hang out Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round Get on your bikes and ride Oooh yeah them fat bottomed girls Fat bottomed girls, Yeah, yeah, yeah Fat bottomed girls, Yes, yes",
