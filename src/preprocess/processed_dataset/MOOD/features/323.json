    "cleaned_text": "Crack of dawn I hit the road, set my shoulders for the heavy load Coffee leaking through the paper sack The foreman says I'm late again, he can't stand it when I only grin He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time She got something cookin' for me tonight She keeps the home fires burning While I'm out earning a living in a world That's known for its pouring rain She keeps the home fires burning Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again And again Out of gas, just my luck, four bald tires on my pickup truck No more credit on my credit card When I come home and hit that door I remember what these aching arms are for She's my one light when the world goes dark Tomorrow it's the same old grind But she'll be burning in my mind She keeps the home fires burning While I'm out earning a living in a world That's known for its pouring rain She keeps the home fires burning Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again She keeps the home fires burning Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again Home fires burning While I'm out earning a living in a world She keeps the home fires burning Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again She keeps the home fires burning While I'm out earning a living in a world That's known for its pouring rain",
