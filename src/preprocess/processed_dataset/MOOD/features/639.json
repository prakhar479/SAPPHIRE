    "cleaned_text": "It's one o'clock and time for lunch, When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench, I can always hear them talk. There's always been Ethel: \"Jacob, wake up! You've got to tidy your room now.\" And then Mister Lewis: \"Isn't it time that he was out on his own?\" Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you! Keep them moving blades sharp... I know what I like, and I like what I know; getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show. Sunday night, Mr Farmer called, said: \"Listen son, you're wasting your time; there's a future for you in the fire escape trade. Come up to town!\" But I remebered a voice from the past; \"Gambling only plays when you're winning\" - I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure. Keep them moving blades sharp... I know what I like, and I like what I know; getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show. When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench, I can always hear them talk. Me, I'm just a lawnmower - you can tell me by the way I walk.",
