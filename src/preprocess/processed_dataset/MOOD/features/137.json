    "cleaned_text": "Guess who just got back today Them wild-eyed boys, that'd been away Haven't changed, had much to say But man I still think them cats are great They were asking if you were around How you was, where you could be found Told them you were living downtown Driving all the old men crazy The Boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) (I Said) The boys are back in town The boys are back in town The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) You know that chic who used to dance a lot? Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she got Man when I tell you she was cool she was red hot I mean she was steamin' And that time over at Johnny's place Well this chic got up and slapped Johnny's face Man we just fell about the place What that chic don't wanna know forget 'er The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) (I said) The boys are back in town The boys are back in town The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) Spread the word around Guess who's back in town You spread the word around Friday night they'll be dressed to kill Down at Dino's bar and grill The drinks will flow and blood would spill If the boys wanna fight you better let 'em That kid rocks down at the corner blasting out my favourite song The nights are getting warmer and won't be long Wont be long till the summer comes Now that the boys are here again The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town) The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town) The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town) (Spread the word around) The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) (The boys are back, the boys are back) The boys are back in town again They're hanging out at Dino's The boys are back in town again",
