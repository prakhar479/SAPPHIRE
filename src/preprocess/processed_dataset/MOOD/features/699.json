Here we go yo, here we go yo So what so what so what's the scenario Here we go yo, here we go yo So what so what so what's the scenario Verse One: Phife Dawg Aiyyo Bo knows this (what?) and Bo knows that (what?) But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap Well whaddya know? the Di-Dawg is first up to bat No batteries included, and no strings attached No holds barred, no time for move fakin Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so Sleep if you want, my crew will help you get your Z's troop But here's the real scoop I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from I'm vexed, fumin, I've had it up to here My days of payin dues are over, acknowledge we is in there(YEAH) Head for the border, go get a taco I'll be wreckin from the jump street, meaning from the get-go Sit back relax and let yourself go Don't sweat what you heard, and act like you know Verse Two: Charlie Brown Yes yes y'all (yes y'all!) who got the vibe it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all!) real live y'all (live y'all!) Inside outside come around... (who's that??) Browwwwwwwwn Some may, I say, call me Charlie The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley Layback on the payback, [evolve rotate the gates?] CONTACT! Can I get a hit? (HIT!) Boom bit with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip East coast stompin, rippin and rompin New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton Checka-checka-check it out! The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce And wow how now wow how now Brown cow We're ill till the skill gets down For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new but the rest are doo-doo From radio, to the video, to Arsenio Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario Verse Three: Dinco D (True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo Scenario's ready yo, rates more than four Scores for the snores that smother dancefloors Now I go for mine, shave the seashore Ship-shape crushed Grapes Apes that play tapes Papes make drakes baked for the wakes of an L-ah, An E-ah, simply just a leader bass in his face means peace see ya later Later? (LATER!) Later alligator Pop goes the weasel and the herb's the inflater So yo the D what the O, incorporated I-N-C into a flow Funk flipped flat back first fist foul fight fight fight Laugh yo how's that sound (ohhhhhh!) Verse Four: Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here(here!) Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!) I could give a damn about a ill subliminal Stay away from crime SO I ain't no CRIMINAL <---- I love my young nation, groovy sensation No time for hibernation, only elation Don't ever try to test the water little kid Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did I heard you rushed and rushed, AND ATTACKED Then they rebuked and you had TO SMACK Causin rambunction, throughout the sphere Raise the levels of the boom, inside the ear You know I did it So don't violate or you get violated The hip-hop sound is well agitated Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego So here's Busta Rhymes with the, Scenario Verse Five: Busta Rhymes Watch, as I combine all the juice from the mind Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind Powerful impact BOOM! from the cannon Not braggin, try to read my mind just imagine Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary When diggin into my library Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Eating ITAL stew like the one Peter Tosh-a UH uh UH, all over the track, man UH, pardon me, UH, as I come back As I did it yo I had to beg your pardon When I travel to the Sun I roll with the squadron RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon Change your little drawers cause your pants are saggin Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban And have u smelling rank, like some old stale urine Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken The rear cockdiesel but chicks they were kicking Yo, bustin out before the Busta bust a nut the rhyme the rhythm is in sync (UHH!) the rhymes are on time (TIME!)
