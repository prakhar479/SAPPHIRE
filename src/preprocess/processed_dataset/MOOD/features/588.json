She's Lump, she's Lump She's in my head She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump She might be dead Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love She spent her twenties between the sheets Life limped along at subsonic speeds She's Lump, she's Lump She's in my head She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump She might be dead Is this Lump out of my head, I think so Is this Lump out of my head, I think so, yeah Is this Lump out of my head, I think so Is this Lump out of my head",
