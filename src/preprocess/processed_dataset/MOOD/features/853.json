We'll just pass him there why should we even care? He was turned to steel in the great magnetic field When he travelled time for the future of mankind Nobody wants him He just stares at the world Planning his vengeance that he will soon unfurl Now the time is here for Iron Man to spread fear Vengeance from the grave Kills the people he once saved Nobody wants him They just turn their heads Nobody helps him Now he has his revenge Heavy boots of lead fills his victims full of dread Running as fast as they can Iron Man lives again!",
