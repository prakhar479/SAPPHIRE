    "cleaned_text": "Jennifer dates a man in a 60s cover band He's the Ess-dog, or Sean if you wish She's 18, he's 31 She's a rich girl, he's the son Of a Coca-Cola middle man Kiss when they listen To \"Brothers In Arms\" And if there's something wrong with this They don't see the harm In joining their forces and singing along See those rings on her toes Check that frisbee in his Volvo It's a Volvo with ancient plates They've got a dog she named Trey A retriever with a frayed bandana around his neck Trey has a window into their relationship The baby talk voices And the post class-a nasal drip But it all seems to function At least in her dog's mind Let me out of here Let me out of here You got to let me out of here You got to let me out of here Let me out of here Out of here Out of here, out of here Let me out of here ill hit the ground running Jennifer left for school up in Boulder And the Ess-dog came to visit when he could But the strain was too much They could not make up for distance And the distance between their years Neither one listens To \"Brothers In Arms\" The Ess-dog waits tables And he sold his guitar Jenny pledged Kappa and she started pre-law And off came those awful toe rings Off came those awful toe rings",
