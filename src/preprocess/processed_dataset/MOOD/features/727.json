Heaven holds a place for those who pray, Hey, hey, hey We'd like to know a little bit about your for our files We'd like to help you learn to help yourself. Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes, Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home. And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson. Heaven holds a place for those who pray, Hey, hey, hey Hide in the hiding place where no one ever goes. Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes. It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair. Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids. Koo-koo-ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson. Heaven holds a place for those who pray, Hey, hey, hey Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon. Going to the candidate's debate. Laugh about it, shout about it When you've got to choose Every way you look at this you lose. Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, Our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you. What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson. Jotting Joe has left and gone away, Hey hey hey.",
