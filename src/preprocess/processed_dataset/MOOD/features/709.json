I smile and I wave and I hide all my pain but the sign on my bumper gives me away: Honk if you're lonely tonight If you need a friend to get through the night A toot on your horn, a flash of your brights Honk if you're lonely tonight.

We'll laugh and we'll flirt and we'll dance every dance and before the night's over we'll take a chance. The morning will find us with a smile on our face and we'll be together in a lover's embrace.
