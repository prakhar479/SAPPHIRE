We had something to learn Now it's time for the wheel to turn Things are said one by one Before you know it's all gone Let's admit we made a mistake, but Can we still be friends? Heartbreak's never easy to take, but Can we still be friends? It's a strange sad affair Sometimes seems like we just don't care Don't waste time feeling hurt We've been through hell together La la la la, la la la la Can we still be friends? Can we still get together sometime? We awoke from our dream Things are not always what they seem Memories linger on It's like a sweet sad old song",
