    "cleaned_text": "Make a hole with a gun perpendicular To the name of this town in a desk-top globe Exit wound in a foreign nation Showing the home of the one this was written for My apartment looks upside down from there Water spirals the wrong way out the sink And her voice is a backwards record It's like a whirlpool and it never ends Ana Ng and I are getting old And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence Listen Ana hear my words They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you All alone at the '64 World's Fair Eighty dolls yelling \"Small girl after all\" Who was at the Dupont Pavilion? Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there? Or the time when the storm tangled up the wire To the horn on the pole at the bus depot And in the back of the edge of hearing These are the words the voice was repeating: Ana Ng and I are getting old And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence Listen Ana hear my words They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you When I was driving once I saw this painted on a bridge, \"I don't want the world, I just want your half\" They don't need me here, and I know you're there (don't need me) Where the world goes by like the humid air (world goes by) And it sticks like a broken record Everything sticks like a broken record Everything sticks until it goes away (it goes home) And the truth is, we don't know anything (don't know) Ana Ng and I are getting old And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence Listen Ana hear my words They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you Ana Ng and I are getting old And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence Listen Ana hear my words They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you Ana Ng and I are getting old And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence Listen Ana hear my words They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you",
