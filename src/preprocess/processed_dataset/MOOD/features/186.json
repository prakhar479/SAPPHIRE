Deep in the heart of Texas And round the 'Frisco Bay All over St.Louis And down in New Orleans All the cats wanna dance with Sweet Little Sixteen Sweet Little Sixteen She's just got to have About half a million Famed autographs Her wallet filled with pictures She gets them one by one Becomes so excited Watch her, look at her run. \"Oh Mommy, Mommy Please may I go It's such a sight to see Somebody steal the show\" \"Oh Daddy, Daddy I beg of you Whisper to Mommy It's alright with you\" 'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand In Philadelphia, Pa. Deep in the heart of Texas And round the 'Frisco Bay All over St.Louis Way down in New Orleans All the cats wanna dance with Sweet Little Sixteen 'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand In Philadelphia, Pa. Deep in the heart of Texas And round the 'Frisco Bay All over St.Louis Way down in New Orleans All the cats wanna dance with Sweet Little Sixteen Sweet Little Sixteen She's got the grown - up blues Tight dresses and lipstick She's sportin' high - heel shoes Oh but tomorrow morning She'll have to change her trend And be sweet sixteen And back in class again Well the'll be rockin' in Boston Pittsburgh, Pa. Deep in the heart of Texas And round the 'Frisco Bay Way out in St.Louis Way down in New Orleans All the cats wanna dance with Sweet Little Sixteen",
