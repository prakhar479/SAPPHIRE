The lights are much brighter there You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares So go downtown, things'll be great when you're Downtown - no finer place, for sure Downtown - everything's waiting for you Don't hang around and let your problems surround you There are movie shows - downtown Maybe you know some little places to go to Where they never close - downtown Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over Happy again The lights are much brighter there You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares So go downtown, where all the lights are bright Downtown - waiting for you tonight Downtown - you're gonna be all right now [Instrumental break] And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to Guide them along So maybe I'll see you there We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares So go downtown, things'll be great when you're Downtown - don't wait a minute for Downtown - everything's waiting for you Downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown ...",
