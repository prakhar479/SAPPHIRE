    "cleaned_text": "That big eight-wheeler, rollin' down the track Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back Cause I'm movin'on, I'll soon be gone You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky So I'm movin' on. That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song You had the laugh on me, so I set you free And I'm movin' on. Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll And keep movin' me on. Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand This rattler's the fastest in the southern land To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time And keep rollin' on. I've told you baby, from time to time But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on You've broken your vow, and it's all over now So I'm movin' on. You've switched your engine, now I ain't got time For a triflin' woman on my main line Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong I warned you twice, now you can settle the price Cause I'm movin' on. But someday baby, when you've had your play You're gonna want your daddy, but your daddy will say Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long I'm through with you, too bad you're blue Keep movin' on.",
