I been hurting Since I bought the gimmick About something called love Yeah something called love That's like hypnotizing chickens Well I am just a modern guy Of course I've had it in the ear before 'Cause of a lust for life 'Cause of a lust for life I'm worth a million in prizes With my torture film Drive a G.T.O. Wear a uniform All on a government loan I'm worth a million in prizes Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the Sidewalk - no more beating my brains With the liquor and drugs With the liquor and drugs Well I am just a modern guy Of course I've had it in the ear before 'Cause of a lust for life 'Cause of a lust for life I got a lust for life Got a lust for life Oh a lust for life Oh a lust for life A lust for life I got a lust for life I got a lust for life Well I am just a modern guy Of course I've had it in the ear before 'Cause of a lust for life 'Cause of a lust for life 'Cause of a lust for life Here comes Johnny Yen again With the liquor and drugs And the flesh machine He's gonna do another striptease Hey man where'd you get That lotion?
