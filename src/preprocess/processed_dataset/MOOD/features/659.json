    "cleaned_text": "Blackberry way absolutely pouring down with rain, It's a terrible day. Up with the lark, silly girl I don't know what to say, She was running away. But now I'm standing on the corner, Lost in the things that I said. What am I supposed to do now? Goodbye blackberry way I can't see you, I don't need you. Goodbye blackberry way Sure to want me back another day. Flowers in the park overgrowing but the trees are bare There's a memory there. Boats on the lake, unattended now for all to drown I'm incredibly down. Just like myself they are neglected, Turn with my eyes to the wall What am I supposed to do now? Goodbye blackberry way I can't see you, I don't need you. Goodbye blackberry way Sure to want me back another day. Run for the train, look behind you for she may be there Said a thing in the air Blackberry way, see the battlefield of careless sins Cast to the winds So full of emptiness without her, Lost in the words that I said. What am I supposed to do now? Goodbye blackberry way I can't see you, I don't need you. Goodbye blackberry way Sure to want me back another day. Goodbye blackberry way I can't see you, I don't need you. Goodbye blackberry way Sure to want me back another day.",
