    "cleaned_text": "Oh I marched to the battle of New Orleans At the end of the early British war The young land started growing The young blood started flowing But I ain't marchin' anymore For I've killed my share of Indians In a thousand different fights I was there at the Little Big Horn I heard many men lying I saw many more dying But I ain't marchin' anymore chorus) It's always the old to lead us to the war It's always the young to fall Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun Tell me is it worth it all For I stole California from the Mexican land Fought in the bloody Civil War Yes I even killed my brothers And so many others But I ain't marchin' anymore For I marched to the battles of the German trench In a war that was bound to end all wars Oh I must have killed a million men And now they want me back again But I ain't marchin' anymore (chorus) For I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky Set off the mighty mushroom roar When I saw the cities burning I knew that I was learning That I ain't marchin' anymore Now the labor leader's screamin' when they close the missile plants, United Fruit screams at the Cuban shore, Call it \"Peace\" or call it \"Treason,\" Call it \"Love\" or call it \"Reason,\" But I ain't marchin' any more, No I ain't marchin' any more",
