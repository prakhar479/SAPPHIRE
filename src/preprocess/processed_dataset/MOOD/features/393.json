Dixie, when I let you go Thought you'd realize that I would know I would show the special love I have for you, my baby blue What can I do, what can I say Except I want you by my side How can I show you, show me the way Don't you know the times I've tried? [guitar solo (Joey Molland)] Guess that's all I have to say Except the feeling just grows stronger every day Just one thing before I go Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow The special love you have for me, my Dixie, dear.",
