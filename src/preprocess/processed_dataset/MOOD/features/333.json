I know all this and more So take your hat off when you're talking to me and be there when I feed the tree This little squirrel I used to be slammed her bike down the stairs They put silver where her teeth had been Baby silvertooth, she grins and grins I know all this and more So take your hat off boy when you're talking to me and be there when I feed the tree Take your hat off boy when you're talking to me and be there when I feed the tree This old man I used to be spins around, around, around the tree Silver baby come to me I'll only hurt you in my dreams I know all this and... I know all this and...
