Is this where you want to be? Is this the only life we're gonna have? What we need is [Chorus] They say they've got control of you But that's not true you know They say they're a part of you And that's a lie you know They say you will never be Free free free Get an Alternative Ulster Alternative Ulster Alternative Ulster",
