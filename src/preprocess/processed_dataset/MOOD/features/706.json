    "cleaned_text": "I am not Jesus though I have the same initials - I am the man who stays home and does the dishes. And how was your day? Is that woman still trying to do your head in? A man told me to beware of 33. He said, \"It was not an easy time for me\" But I'll get through Even though I've got no miracles to show you. I'd like to make this water wine But it's impossible. I've got to get these dishes dry. I'll read a story if it helps you sleep at night. I've got some matches if you ever need a light. Oh I am just a man But I'm doing what I can to help you. I'd like to make this water wine But it's impossible. I've got to get these dishes dry. And I'm not worried that I will never touch the stars 'cause stars belong up in heaven And the earth is where we are. Oh yeah. And aren't you happy just to be alive? Anything's possible. You've got no cross to bear tonight. No not tonight. No not tonight. I am not Jesus though I have the same initials.",
