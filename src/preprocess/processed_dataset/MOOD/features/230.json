I kissed her and she kissed me Like the fella once said, \"Ain't that a kick in the head?\" The room was completely black, I hugged her and she hugged back Like the sailor said, quote, \"Ain't that a hole in the boat?\" My head keeps spinnin', I go to sleep and keep grinnin' If this is just the beginnin', my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful I've sunshine enough to spread, it's just like the fella said Tell me quick, ain't that a kick in the head? Like the fella once said, \"Ain't that a kick in the head?\" Like the sailor said, quote, \"Ain't that a hole in the boat?\" My head keeps spinnin', I go to sleep and keep grinnin' If this is just the beginnin', my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful She's tellin' me we'll be wed, she's picked out a king-size bed I couldn't be any better or I'd be sick Tell me quick oh, ain't that a kick? Tell me quick ain't that a kick in the head?",
