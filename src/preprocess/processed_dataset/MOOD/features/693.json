    "cleaned_text": "Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia (Where the suburbs met Utopia) Lost in the high street, where the dogs run Roaming suburban boys Mother's got a hairdo to be done She says they're too old for toys Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen In this suburban hell And in the distance a police car To break the suburban spell Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight In Suburbia You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight In Suburbia Break a window by the town hall Listen, the siren screams There in the distance, like a roll call Of all the suburban dreams Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight In Suburbia You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight In Suburbia I only wanted something else to do but hang around I only wanted something else to do but hang around (Hang around, hang around) It's on the front page of the papers This is their hour of need Where's a policeman when you need one To blame the colour TV? Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight In Suburbia You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight In Suburbia In Suburbia In Suburbia Run with the dogs tonight You can't hide Run with the dogs tonight You can't hide (You can't hide, you can't hide) In Suburbia (Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia) (What kind of dream was this, so easy to destroy?) (A world together, the cities of the past) (Mews, slums of the future) (Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia) (Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia) (Where the suburbs met Utopia)",
