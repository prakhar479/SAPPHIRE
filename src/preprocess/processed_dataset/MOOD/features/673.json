    "cleaned_text": "He had a stroke at the age of 24 It could have been a brilliant career Painting lines in a school that was too well known Painting lines with a friend that had gone before She challenged everyone to a fight But the prefects all backed down And they ran her out of town Cause she drank and swore and spoke Out of turn, she was the village joke She had a stroke at the age of 24 It could have been a brilliant career Getting clients to finance her strategies Filling time in on Safeways on Saturday She wears the clothes of an emperor But her paintings are a sham And they're going for a grand When the dealers come to view Do they ever see the real you? He had a stroke at the age of 24 It could have been a brilliant career Selling lies to the boys with the old Dansettes Pulling the wool, playing the fool, it's no wonder that He is dribbling spit tonight And the one he sent away Was the only one who stayed With a spoon and a decent book And you can tell by the way she looks he is sorry and resigned As he wets himself for the final time",
