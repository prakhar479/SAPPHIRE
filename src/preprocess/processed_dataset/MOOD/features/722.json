    "cleaned_text": "Dear God, hope you get the letter and... I pray you can make it better down here I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer But all the people that you made in your image See them starving in the street Cause they don't get enough to eat from God I can't believe in you Dear god, sorry to disturb you but... I feel that I should be heard loud and clear We all need a big reduction in amount of tears And all the people that you made in your image See them fighting in the street Cause they can't make opinions meet about God I can't believe in you Did you make disease and the diamond blue? Did you make mankind after we made you? And the Devil too! Dear God don't know if you noticed but... Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book And us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look And all the people that you made in your image Still believing that junk is true Well I know it ain't, and so do you Dear God I can't believe in I don't believe I won't believe in heaven or hell No saints, no sinners, no devil as well No pearly gates, no thorny crown You're always letting us humans down The wars you bring, the babes you drown Those lost at sea and never found And it's the same the whole world 'round The hurt I see helps to compound That Father, Son and Holy Ghost Is just somebody's unholy hoax And if you're up there you'll perceive That my heart's here upon my sleeve If there's one thing I don't believe in It's you Dear God",
