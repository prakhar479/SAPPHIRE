    "cleaned_text": "Ugly apparition, God's gift to oxygen The puffed up immortal son How they love him cause he'll become The ghost at number one How does it feel To be the only one? How does it feel To be the only one that knows that you're right? How does it feel To be a loaded gun? How does it feel Inside a chamber packed with piss and spite? Sure life's no cherry but a cupake for the meek (shootupbopbop) (Like a valen....tiiiiiiiiiiiine) So he shoots up his poison until the frosting tastes so sweet Yeah he's givin' it all he's got the king of rebels hit the jackpot But his finish line was an artistic flop Even the critics can't outrun The ghost at number one How does it feel To be the only one? How does it feel To be the only one that knows that you're right? How does it feel To be a chalkline dollar sign How does it feel Up at the address all the widows write? Mrs.Lynn the fruit of your labour Gives us a saviour, nappy superstar. To you we bid congtatulations, to him adulation. A blessed life begun, for the ghost at number one. How does it feel To be the only one? How does it feel To be the only one that knows that you're right? How does it feel To be a visionary poet How does it feel To pack a pen with vinegar and insight How does it feel To be the only one? How does it feel To be the only one that knows that you're right? How does it feel To be a so deep down underground? How does it feel To be the only one who knows you've been buried alive? Mrs. Lynn the fruit of your labour Gives us a saviour.",
