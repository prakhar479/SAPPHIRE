    "cleaned_text": "A court is in session, a verdict is in, No appeal on the docket today, Just my own sin, The walls cold and pale, The cage made of steel, Screams fill the room, Alone I drop and kneel, (And I said oh) So I held my head up high, Hiding hate that burns inside, Which only fuels their selfish pride, (And I said oh) All held captive, Out from the sun, A sun that shines on only some, We the meek are all in one, I hear a thunder in the distance, See a vision of a cross, I feel the pain that was given, On that sad day of loss, A lion roars in the darkness, Only he holds the key, A light to free me from my burden, And grant me life eternally, Should have been dead, On a Sunday morning, Banging my head, No time for mourning, Ain't got no time. 2x (And I said oh) So I held my head up high, Hiding hate that burns inside, Which only fuels their selfish pride, (And I said oh) We're all held captive, Out from the sun, A sun that shines on only some, We the meek are all in one, [Guitar break] I cry out to God, Seeking only his decision, Gabriel stands and confirms, I've created my own prison. 2x (And I said oh) So I held my head up high, Hiding hate that burns inside, Which only fuels their selfish pride. (And I said oh) We're all held captive, Out from the sun. A sun that shines for only some, We the meek are all in on. (And I said oh) So I held my head up high, Hiding hate that burns inside, Which only fuels their selfish pride. (And I said oh)(I created, I created...) We're all held captive, Out from the sun. A sun that shines for only some, We the meek are all in on. (my own prison) Should've been dead on a Sunday morning, banging my head, No time for mourning, Ain't got no time, CARLOS A RIA O",
