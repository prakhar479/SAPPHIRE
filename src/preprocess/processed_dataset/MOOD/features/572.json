Here come the click of dice Roulette and blackjacks - gonna build us a paradise Larger than life and twice as ugly If we have to live there, you'll have to drug me Maybe these luxuries can only compensate For all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate So tell me Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire! Millionaire! Billionaire! Trillionaire! Hardly surprising if you might consider Loyalties go to the highest of bidders What's my opinion? I'd give you ten to one Give me a million, a franchise on fun But there are millions who often get nowhere And there's just one secret I think you should share Maybe these luxuries can only compensate For all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate So tell me Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire! Who wants to be millionaire? I do! - I don't! - I do! Who wants to be millionaire? I do! - I don't! I've seen the future and I can't afford it",
