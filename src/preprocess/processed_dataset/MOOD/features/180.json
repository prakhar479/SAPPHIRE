    "cleaned_text": "I wonder how you're feeling there's ringing in my ears. And no one to relate to 'cept the sea. Who can I believe in ? I'm kneeling on the floor. There has to be a force. Who do I phone ? The stars are out and shining. But all I really want to know [Chorus:] Oh won't you show me the way I want you show me the way Well, I can see no reason, you living on your nerves When someone drop a cup and I submerge I'm swimming in a circle, I feel I'm going down There has to be a fool to play my part Someone thought of healing, But all I really want to know I wonder if I'm dreaming I feel so unashamed I can't believe this is happening to me. I watch you when you're sleeping And then I want to take your love Oh won't you show me the way I want you day after day",
