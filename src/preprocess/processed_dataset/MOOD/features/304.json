    "cleaned_text": "You wander around on your own little cloud When you don't see the why or the wherefore You walk out on me when we both disagree 'Cause to reason is not what you care for I've heard it all a million times before Take off your coat, my love, and close the door Don't sleep in the subway, darling Don't stand in the pouring rain Don't sleep in the subway, darling The night is long Forget your foolish pride Nothing's wrong Now you're beside me again You try to be smart, then you take it to heart 'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated You don't realize that it's all compromise And the problems are so overrated Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show So why pretend you've somewhere else to go Don't sleep in the subway, darling Don't stand in the pouring rain Don't sleep in the subway, darling The night is long Forget your foolish pride Nothing's wrong Now you're beside me again Don't sleep in the subway, darling Don't stand in the pouring rain Don't sleep in the subway, darling The night is long Forget your foolish pride Nothing's wrong Now you're beside me again Don't sleep in the subway, darling Don't stand in the pouring rain... ----------------- Songwriters: Yvonne J.
