And I guess I look Different too, cause time changes everything. I wonder what They'll say, when they see their boy looking this bad. Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home Can't remember when I ate It's just thumb and walk and wait And I'm still 500 miles away from home If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight But I'm 500 miles away from home Away from home away from home Oh I'm still 500 miles away from home",
