Oh, won't you save these Bachelor Kisses now, they're for your brow. Oh, won't you save these Bachelor Kisses now, they're for your brow. Hand, hands like hooks, You'll get hurt If you play with crooks. Your hand, that's all he took, The world opened up For your looks. Don't believe what you've heard, \"Faithful\"'s not a bad word. Oh, won't you save these Bachelor Kisses now, they're for your brow. Oh, won't you save these Bachelor Kisses now, they're for your brow. The arcade lights are hanging down. The rain surrenders to the town. The world of men don't mean a thing When all they give you is a diamond ring. Don't believe what you've heard, \"Faithful\"'s not a bad word. Oh, won't you save these Bachelor Kisses now, they're for your brow. Oh, won't you save these Bachelor Kisses now, they're for your brow. But don't be slave to Bachelor Kisses now, they'll break their vow. But don't be slave to Bachelor Kisses now, they'll break their vow.",
