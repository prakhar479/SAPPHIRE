(So do I) Can't I take away all this pain? (You want to see the light) I try to every night, all in vain, in vain Sometimes I cannot take this place Sometimes it's my life I can't taste Sometimes I cannot feel my face You'll never see me fall from grace Something takes a part of me You and I were meant to be A cheap fuck for me to lay Something takes a part of me Feeling like a freak on a leash (You want to see the light) Feeling like I have no release (So do I) How many times have I felt diseased? (You want to see the light) Nothing in my life is free, is free [Chorus] Boom, na, da, mmm, dumb, na, ema Da, boom, na, da, mmm, dumb, na, ema Go! So, fight! Something on the Fight Some things they fight So something on the Fight Some things they fight Fight Something of the No, some things they fight Fight Something of the Fight Some things they fight [Chorus] Part of me Oh",
