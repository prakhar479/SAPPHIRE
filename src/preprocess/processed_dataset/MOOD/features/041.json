(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Ooooo...Crazy on ya Crazy on you Let me go crazy, crazy on you I was a willow last night in my dream I bent down over a clear running stream Sang you the song that I heard up above And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love Crazy Yeah, crazy on ya Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh Crazy on ya Crazy on you Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yeah (Ah-ah-ah-ah) Crazy on ya Crazy on you Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh...",
