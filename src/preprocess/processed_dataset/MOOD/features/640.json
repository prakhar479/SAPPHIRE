    "cleaned_text": "Judy wrote the saddest song She showed it to a boy in school today Judy, where did you go wrong? You used to make me smile when I was down Judy was a teenage rebel She did it with a boy when she was young She gave herself to books and learning She gave herself to being number one Judy, I don't know you if you're gonna show me everything Judy, I don't know you if you're gonna show me everything Judy got a book at school She went under the covers with her torch She fell asleep till it was morning She dreamt about the girl who stole a horse Judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping Judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping Judy, let's go for a walk We can kiss and do whatever you want But you will be disappointed You will fall asleep with ants in your pants Judy, you're just trying to find and keep the dream of horses And the song she wrote was Judy and the Dream of Horses Dream of Horses You dream of horses The best looking boys are taken The best looking girls are staying inside So Judy, where does that leave you? Walking the street from morning to night With a star upon your shoulder lighting up the path that you walk With a parrot on your shoulder, saying everything when you talk If you're ever feeling blue Then write another song about your dream of horses Write a song about your dream of horses Call it Judy And The Dream Of Horses Call it Judy And The Dream Of Horses You dream of horses",
