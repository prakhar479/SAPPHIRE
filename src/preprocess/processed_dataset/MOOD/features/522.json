Sometimes I'd like to quit; Nothing ever seems to fit; Hangin' around, nothing to do but frown; Rainy days and Mondays always get me down What I've got they used to call the blues: Nothin' is really wrong; Feelin' like I don't belong; Walkin' around, some kind of lonely clown; Rainy days and Mondays always get me down Funny, but it seems that I always wind up-a here with you; Nice to know somebody loves me. Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do: Run and find the one who loves me. (*) What I feel is come and gone before: No need to talk it out; We know what it's all about. Hangin' around, nothing to do but frown; Rainy days and Mondays always get me down Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do, Run and find the one who loves me Repeat (*) Hangin' around, nothing do to but frown; Rainy days and Mondays always get me down",
