I don't care about you! Fuck you! I see Hollywood boulevard, welfare hotel, I spent the night in jail, near the Wicox hotel! I don't care about you! Fuck you! I don't care about you! I've seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan. Well he just died while we just stood there lookin' at him. Ain't he cute? I don't care about you! Ohhhhhhhhh! I don't care about you! I see man rollin' drunks, bodies the streets. Some man was sleepin' in puke and a man with no legs crawling down 5th street trying to get something to eat! I don't care about you! Oh noooooo!! I don't care about you! Fuck you! I don't care about you! Hey! Hey! I don't care about you!",
