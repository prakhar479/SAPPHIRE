Yes, honey, I love him, he is fine, he does alot of nice things for me I know he use to do nice stuff for you, but what has he done for you lately? Used to be a time when you would pamper me Usta brag about it all the time Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen But my friends say neglect is on your mind - Who's right? What have you done for me lately? Ooh ooh ooh yeah What have you done for me lately? Ooh ooh ooh yeah Used to go to dinner almost every night Dancin' 'til I thought I'd lose my breath Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death - Ain't that a shame? What have you done for me lately Ooh ooh ooh yeah What have you done for me lately Ooh ooh ooh yeah I never ask for more than I deserve You know it's the truth You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth I'm tellin' you no way You 'ought to be thankful for the little things but little things are all you seem to give You're always putting off what we could do today Soap opera says you've got one life to live Who's right, who's wrong? What have you done for me lately Ooh ooh ooh yeah... Ooh ooh ooh yeah... Get wit it...Uh What have you done for me lately Ooh ooh ooh yeah Ooh ooh ooh yeah This is wild, I swear",
