    "cleaned_text": "Oh God said to Abraham, \"Kill me a son\" Abe says, \"Man, you must be puttin' me on\" God say, \"No.\" Abe say, \"What ?\" God say, \"You can do what you want Abe, but The next time you see me comin' you better run\" Well Abe says, \"Where do you want this killin' done ?\" God says. \"Out on Highway 61\". Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard said there's only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to run Ol' Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61. Well Mack the finger said to Louie the King I got forty red white and blue shoe strings And a thousand telephones that don't ring Do you know where I can get ride of these things And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son And he said yes I think it can be easily done Just take everything down to Highway 61. Now the fift daughter on the twelfth night Told the first father that things weren't right My complexion she said is much too white He said come here and step into the light he says hmmm you're right Let me tell second mother this has been done But the second mother was with the seventh son And they were both out on Highway 61. Now the rowin' gambler he was very bored He was tryin' to create a next world war He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before But yes I think it can be very easily done We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun And have it on Highway 61.",
