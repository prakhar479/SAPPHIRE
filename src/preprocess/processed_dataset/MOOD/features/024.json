    "cleaned_text": "Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans Then you can understand just what i mean All thru the week it's quiet as a mouse But on saturday night they go from house to house You don't have to pay the usual admission If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician So if you happen to be just passin' by Stop in at the saturday night fish fry It was rockin', it was rockin' You never seen such scufflin' And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn It was rockin', it was rockin' You never seen such scufflin' And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn Now my buddy and me was on the main stem Foolin' around just me and him We decided we could use a little something to eat So we went to a house on rampart street We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease And a lush little miss said, \"come in, please\" And before we could even bat an eye We were right in the middle of a big fish fry It was rockin', it was rockin' You never seen such scufflin' And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn It was rockin', it was rockin' You never seen such scufflin' And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn Now the folks was havin' the time of their life And sam was jivin' jimmie's wife Over in the corner was a beat up grand Being played by a big fat piano man Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks Some of them had on bobbie socks But everybody was nice and high At this particular saturday night fish fry It was rockin', it was rockin' You never seen such scufflin' And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn It was rockin', it was rockin' You never seen such scufflin' And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'",
