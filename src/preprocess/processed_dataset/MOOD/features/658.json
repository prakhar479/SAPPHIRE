    "cleaned_text": "Woke up one morning half asleep With all my blankets in a heap And yellow roses scattered all around The time was still approaching For I couldn't stand it anymore Some marigolds upon my eiderdown I'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain Feel the power of the rain making the garden grow I'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain Feel the power of the rain keeping me good So I lay upon my side With all the windows open wide Couldn't pressurize my head from speaking Hoping not to make a sound I pushed my bed into the grounds In time to catch the sight that I was seeking [repeat] If this perfect pleasure has to be Then this is paradise to me If my pillow's getting wet I can't see that it matters much to me I heard the flowers in the breeze Make conversation with the trees Relieved to leave reality behind me With my commitments in a mess My sleep is not a way of rest In a world of fantasy you'll find me [repeat] Watching flowers in the rain Flowers in the rain Power flowers in the rain Flower power in the rain [fade out]",
