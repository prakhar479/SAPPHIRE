All that summertime I revolved around your eye In accelerating spirals in an asymmetric sky You slow down you slow down my lights are changing You slow down you slow down my lights are changing You fly so high yeah and you move so fast You're running blindly from the past Slow down slow down green lights are changing Oh changing all the time Oh changing all the time You slow down you slow down lights are changing You slow down you slow down my lights are changing Well you slow down you slow down my lights are changing",
