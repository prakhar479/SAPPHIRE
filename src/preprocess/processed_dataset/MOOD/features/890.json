If I get by, it's mine Mine all mine! My girl, she's one too She'll go and get her a shirt Stick it under her skirt She grabbed a razor for me And she did it just like that When she wants something, she don't want to pay for it She walk right through the door Walk right through the door Hey all right! If I get by, it's mine Mine all mine! We sat around the pile We sat and laughed We sat and laughed and waved it into the air! And we did it just like that When we want something, we don't want to pay for it We walk right through the door Walk right through the door Hey, all right! If I get by, it's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. . .",
