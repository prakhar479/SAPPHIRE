    "cleaned_text": "Make a new cult every day to suit your affairs Kissing girls in English at the back of the stairs You're a honey with a following of innocent boys They never know it Because you never show it You always get your way They never know it Because you never show it You always get your way Have you and her been taking pictures of your obsessions? Cause I met a boy who went through one of your sessions In his blue velour and silk You liberated A boy I never rated And now he's throwing discus For Liverpool and Widnes You liberated A boy I never rated And now he's doing business The stars of track and field, you are The stars of track and field, you are The stars of track and field are beautiful people Could I write a piece about you now that you've made it? About the hours spent, the wilderness in your training You only did it so that you could wear Terry underwear And feel the city air Run past your body Your terry underwear And feel the city air Run past your body Could I write a requiem for you when you're dead? \"She had the moves, she had the speed, it went to her head\" She never needed anyone to get her round the track But when she's on her back She had the knowledge To get her into college But when she's on her back She had the knowledge To get her where she wanted The stars of track and field, you are The stars of track and field, you are The stars of track and field are beautiful people",
