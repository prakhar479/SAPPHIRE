Here you come again, just when I'm about to make it work without you, you look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies and pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you. All you gotta do is smile that smile and there go all my defenses. Just leave it up to you and in a little while you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses. Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to; and shakin' me up so that all I really know is here you come again and here I go. All you gotta do is smile that smile and there got all my defenses. Just leave it up to you and in a little while you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses.
