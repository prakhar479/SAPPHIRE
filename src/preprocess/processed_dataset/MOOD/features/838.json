My my, sun is pie There's fodder for the cannons And the guilty ones can all sleep safely All sleep safely. And all the world is football shaped, It's just for me to kick in space And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste And I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime Trying to take this all in, I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes The pain and the pleasure and The church bells softly chime... Hey hey, night fights day, There's food for the thinkers And the innocents can all live slowly All live slowly My, my the sky will cry Jewels for the thirsty and the guilty ones can All die slowly all die slowly. And all the world is biscuit shaped, It's just for me to feed my face And I can see,hear, smell, touch, taste And I've got one, two,three, four, five sense working overtime Trying to take this all in, I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime... And birds might fall from black skies And bullies might give you black eyes And buses might skid on black ice But to me it's very very beautiful (England's glory!) Beautiful (a striking beauty!) And all the world is football - shaped, It's just for me to kick in space And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste - And I've got one,two,three,four,five senses working overtime Trying to take this all in, I've got one,two,three, four,five senses working overtime Try to tell the difference 'tween the goods and crimes, Dirt or treasure and there's One, two, three, four,five senses working overtime Trying to take this all in, I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime...",
