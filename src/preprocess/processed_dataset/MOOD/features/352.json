    "cleaned_text": "HERE (written by S. Malkmus/S. Kannberg of Pavement; the lyrics, as sung by Stuart, vary slightly from the original, printed lyrics) I was dressed for success But success, it never comes And I'm the only one who laughs At your jokes when they are so bad And you're jokes are always bad But they're not as bad as this Chorus: Come join us in a prayer We'll be waiting, waiting where Everything's ending here And all the sterile striking it Defends an empty dock you cast away And rain upon your forehead Where the mist's for hire If it's just too clear Let's spend our last 1/4 stance randomly Go down to the outlet once again Painted portrait of minions and slaves Crotch mavens and one night plays Are they the only ones who laugh? At the jokes when they are so bad And the jokes are always bad But they're not as bad as this (chorus) And all the Spanish candles unsold Have gone away to this And a \"run-on piece of mount on\" Trembles, shivers runs down the freeway I guess she spent her last quarter randomly I guess a guess is the best I'll do",
