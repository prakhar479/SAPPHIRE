    "cleaned_text": "princelisten homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away Just last week when I was walking down the street I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet I walked up to her I said hello She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know But by the way sweetheart what's your name She said my friends like to call me exotic elaine I said my name is the prince and she said why I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy But enough about me yo let's talk about you And all the wonderful things that you and I can do I popped some cash and in a little bit of time I showed some cash and the girl was mine I took her over town I wined her and dined her She ask me did I like her I said well kinda All of a sudden she jumped out her seat Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin She got mad looked me dead in my face Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape I got scared when she started to yell So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell I was duckin through alleys right and left But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death I was arrested charged with agrivated assault (yo clancy we got him) But it wasn't my fault Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away I was in a bar one friday night Cooling watching a mike tyson fight I was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequilla When this girl walked up she said hi my name is sheila I responded by saying hello She paid for my drink and then said let's go 20 minutes later things were starting to cook As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses She started winking and making little passes At me she pat me close that's when she got bold She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets I felt that it was time for me to make my move I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window Just my luck we were in a snow storm And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm And to top the night off I had to break in my place Because my keys were on pants back on sheila's book case I was done sneezing and coughing I hope this doesn't happen to often But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here I got a ring on my phone may 5th last year It was my girlfriend betty I said hello dear I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the run dmc concert (I'm wit it) It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready (yeah) Aight fine see you then betty I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ? ? ? ? Got to betty's at eight I was ready to jet Until betty's mon said betty's not ready yet I sat there for at least an hour It was ten after nine before she got in the shower 9:35 she comes downstairs And said I need a little longer to finish my hair At ten o'clock we had then missed the show She comes downstairs and says let's go Go where go to sleep I'm gone I was steamin like a demon as I drove home But it just goes to show Not trying to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away Jazzy: Man first your parents just don't understand Then you having these crazy nightmares Prince: I know why me man why me Jazzy: what's next Prince: now these girls man you know how it is Can't live wit 'em can't live wit'out 'em",
