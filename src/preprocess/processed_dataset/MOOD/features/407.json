    "cleaned_text": "Every time I think of you I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find Living a life that I can't leave behind There's no sense in telling me The wisdom of a fool won't set you free But that's the way that it goes And it's what nobody knows While every day my confusion grows Chorus: Every time I see you falling I get down on my knees and pray I'm waiting for that final moment You'll say the words that I can't say I feel fine and I feel good I feeling like I never should Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday? I'm not sure what this could mean I don't think you're what you seem I do admit to myself That if I hurt someone else Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be Every time I see you falling I get down on my knees and pray I'm waiting for that final moment You'll say the words that I can't say",
