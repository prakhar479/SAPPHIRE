    "cleaned_text": "I can hardly bare the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray Lyin' cold the way you left them at least your lips caressed them while you packed And a lip print on a half-filled cup of coffeethat you poured and didn't drink But at least you thought you wanted it that's so much more than I can say for me But what a good year for the roses many blooms still linger there The lawn could stand another mowin' it's funny I don't even care And when you turned and walked away and as the door behind you closes The only thing I know to say it's been a good year for the roses After three full years of marriage it's the first time that you haven't made the bed I guess the reason we're not talkin' there's so little left to say we haven't said While a million thoughts go running through my mind I find I haven't spoke a word And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard But what a good year for the roses",
