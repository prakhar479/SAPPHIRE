    "cleaned_text": "Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night? Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight. And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light. Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night? Well, Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down. But when you are up, she's the kind you want to take around. But Dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground. Yes Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down. Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind, But I came into Dallas with a Dollar and a dime. Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eye A steel and concrete soul with a warm hearted love disguise A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes",
