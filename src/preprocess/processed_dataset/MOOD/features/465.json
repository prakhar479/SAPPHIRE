I know you have a little life in you yet. I know you have a lot of strength left. I know you have a little life in you yet. I know you have a lot of strength left. I should be crying, but I just can't let it show. I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking Of all the things I should've said, That I never said. All the things we should've done, Though we never did. All the things I should've given, But I didn't. Oh, darling, make it go, Make it go away. Give me these moments back. Give them back to me. Give me that little kiss. Give me your hand. (I know you have a little life in you yet. I know you have a lot of strength left. I know you have a little life in you yet. I know you have a lot of strength left.) I should be crying, but I just can't let it show. I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking Of all the things we should've said, That we never said. All the things we should've done, Though we never did. All the things that you needed from me. All the things that you wanted for me. All the things that I should've given, But I didn't. Oh, darling, make it go away. Just make it go away now.",
