WAS A MARTIAN!!!! Now in twenty-eight years of eating hamburgers I ain't never run into no Martian Not at 2:30 in the morning and certainly Not at a fine scarfing establishment like Eat Well, he was sitting over there with a Bunch of colored sticks on his plate And I looked over at him and I said What you eating there, boy, crayons He said: why no they're Martian cigarettes Here, try one Well, 'bout half hour later He looked over at me and smiled Them Martians ain't got But two teeth in their head And he said: how do you feel And I said, well, I feel so good Yeah, I do, gonna boogie Meanwhile, back at Eat's I was still thinking, I said How come out of all the places You could have landed You wound up here He said: well, according To my lunar space map This town here is supposed to be The boogie capital of the U.S.A So I asked him, I said Now, where else you been, boy And he told me He said, I've rocked 'em over And I've rocked 'em down Rocked 'em in the country I've rocked 'em in town Rock and roll been so good to me A lady and she asked my name Told her my name was on ten of my shirt Told her, rocking chair Martian Don't have to work Yeah, I feel so good Yeah, yeah, gonna boogie Martian boogie",
