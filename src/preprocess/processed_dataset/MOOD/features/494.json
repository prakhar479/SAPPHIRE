    "cleaned_text": "Sweet Lady Mary has to rest her poor head Wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed I tried to help her, but I did not know how I tried to love her, but it's all over now Nothing left to comfort me, except a sunny day Steal away, steal away Over the stones along the dusty old road With every footstep one more tale is told With every turning one more side to see Sweet Lady Mary's seen the last of me A lesson is learnt, I'll never come this way again I'll steal away, steal away Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget The lady lied with every breath, I accept Was a matter of time before my face did not fit I knew all along I'd have to quit. Anyway now, I better not waste anymore of your time I'll steal away, steal away I think I'll go back home and start all again Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain And on a new day when I've mended the wound Sweet Lady Mary's gate I swear I'll be bound But before I sit down again and waste anymore of your time I better steal away, steal away Ooh-hoo Steal away-ay.",
