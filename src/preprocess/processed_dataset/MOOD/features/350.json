    "cleaned_text": "I don't want to hear a love song I got on this airplane just to fly And i know there's life below But all that it can show me Is the prairie and the sky And i don't want to hear a sad story Full of heartbreak and desire The last time i felt like this It was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire And i stood on the mountain in the night and i watched it burn I watched it burn, i watched it burn. I would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham I would hold my life in his saving grace. I would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham If i thought i could see, i could see your face. Well you really got me this time And the hardest part is knowing i'll survive. I have come to listen for the sound Of the trucks as they move down Out on ninety five And pretend that it's the ocean Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean Baby do you know what i mean I would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham I would hold my life in his saving grace. I would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham If i thought i could see, i could see your face.",
