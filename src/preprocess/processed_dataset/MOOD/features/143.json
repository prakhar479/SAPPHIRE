It's been a long time and I'm seeing the world Through different eyes, through different eyes. Oh baby, I ain't begging but I feel like dancing And would you let a city boy Hold hands with you? I wanna get to know you. I never thought of myself as tied down, But I was so much in love. It was good that she put me down, I need someone new, someone who's Gonna make my heart jump the way she usta do. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I think I'm falling in love again. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. They make me glad I'm a man, I said. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I feel so good, that's right! I take a green eyed girl, she's going to the square, I'll take a chance, although I ain't going nowhere. But I wanna go, I wanna go too. I'll take a northern girl when her parents ain't home We watching TV and we're all alone And I wanna know all kindsa girls. I never thought I'd see the day she'd turn her back on me. But my baby get's her way today. I need someone new, someone who's Gonna make my heart jump the way she usta do. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I'm falling in love again. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. You know I'm glad I'm a man, I said. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I feel so good inside All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. baby, I have just the feel alive All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I'm falling in love again. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I'm glad I'm a man, I said. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I feel so good, inside All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. You know I have just the feel alive All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I'm falling in love again. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I'm glad I'm a man, I said. All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls. I feel so good, inside All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.
