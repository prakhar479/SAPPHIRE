    "cleaned_text": "(Got to have soul!) POS: 3 That's the Magic Number Yes it is It's the magic number Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community Was born 3 Mase, Dove and me And that's the magic number (What does it all mean?) Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart Something that stimulates the music in my measure Measure in my music, raised in three parts Casually see but don't do like the Soul 'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air Criticising rap shows you're out of order Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production It stands for \"Da Inner Sound Y'all\" and y'all can bet That the action's not a trick, but showing the function Everybody wants to be a deejay Everybody wants to be an emcee But being speakers are the best And you don't have to guess De La Soul posse consists of three And that's the magic number DOVE: This here piece of the pie Is not dessert but the course that we dine And three out of every darn time The effect is \"Mmmm\" when a daisy grows in your mind Showing true position, this here piece is Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' When that negative number fills up the casualty Maybe you can subtract it You can call it your lucky partner Maybe you can call it your adjective But odd as it may be Without my 1 and 2 where would there be My 3 Mase Pos and Me And that's the Magic Number Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds Common are speakers who are never scrolls Scrolls written daily creates a new sound Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em For now get 'em high off this dialect drug Time is a factor so it's time to count Count not the negative actions of one Speakers of soul say it's time to shout Three forms the soul to a positive sum Dance to this fix and flex every muscle Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number Now you may try to subtract it But it just won't go away Three times one? (What is it?) (One, two, three!) And that's the Magic Number (Yo, what's up?) (1, 2, 3) (I say, children, what does it all mean?) (Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3) (I wouldn't lie to you) (No more no less, that's the magic number) (No more no less) (What it is?) (No more no less) (Is this the future?) (No more no less) (Do the shang-a-lang) (No more no less) (No one on the subway ever chats to me) (No more no less) (Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?) (No more no less) (How high's the water, mama?) (No more no less) (How high's the water, mama?) (No more no less) (Three feet high and rising) (No more no less) (Three) (That's the magic number)",
