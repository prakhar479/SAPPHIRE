And what's wrong with that? I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; Say can't you see? Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me Now can't you see, what's wrong with that I need to know, 'cause here I go again I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. Love doesn't come in a minute, Sometimes it doesn't come at all I only know that when I'm in it It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, Love isn't silly at all. How can I tell you about my loved one? How can I tell you about my loved one? How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you) How can i tell you about my loved one? (I love you) [repeat and fade]",
