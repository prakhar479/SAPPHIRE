    "cleaned_text": "And you know the sun's settin' fast, And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts. Well, go on now and kiss it goodbye, But hold on to your lover, 'Cause your heart's bound to die. Go on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town. Can't you see the sun's settin' down on our town, on our town, Goodnight. Up the street beside that red neon light, That's where I met my baby on one hot summer night. He was the tender and I ordered a beer, It's been forty years and I'm still sitting here. But you know the sun's settin' fast, And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts. Well, go on now and kiss it goodbye, But hold on to your lover, 'Cause your heart's bound to die. Go on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town. Can't you see the sun's settin' down on our town, on our town, Goodnight. It's here I had my babies and I had my first kiss. I've walked down Main Street in the cold morning mist. Over there is where I bought my first car. It turned over once but then it never went far. And I can see the sun's settin' fast, And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts. Well, go on now and kiss it goodbye, But hold on to your lover, 'Cause your heart's bound to die. Go on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town. Can't you see the sun's settin' down on our town, on our town, Goodnight. I buried my Mama and I buried my Pa. They sleep up the street beside that pretty brick wall. I bring them flowers about every day, but I just gotta cry when I think what they'd say. If they could see how the sun's settin' fast, And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts. Well, go on now and kiss it goodbye, But hold on to your lover, 'Cause your heart's bound to die. Go on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town. Can't you see the sun's settin' down on our town, on our town, Goodnight. Now I sit on the porch and watch the lightning-bugs fly. But I can't see too good, I got tears in my eyes. I'm leaving tomorrow but I don't wanna go. I love you, my town, you'll always live in my soul. But I can see the sun's settin' fast, And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts. Well, go on, I gotta kiss you goodbye, But I'll hold to my lover, 'Cause my heart's 'bout to die. Go on now and say goodbye to my town, to my town. I can see the sun has gone down on my town, on my town, Goodnight. Goodnight.",
