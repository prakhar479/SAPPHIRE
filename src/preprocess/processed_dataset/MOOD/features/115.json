    "cleaned_text": "Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train goin' anywhere Just a city boy, born and raised right here in Houston He took the midnight train goin' anywhere (Neil!) A singer in a smokey room A smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile they can share the night It goes on and on and on, come on Strangers, waiting, up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlights, people, living just to find emotion Hiding, somewhere in the night Working hard to get my fill, Everybody wants a thrill Payin anything to roll the dice, Just one more time Some will win, some will lose Some were born to sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlights, people, oh they're living to find emotion Hiding, somewhere in the night Don't stop believin' Hold on to that feelin' Streetlight people Don't stop believin' Hold on Streetlight people Don't stop believin' Hold on Houston to your feelin' Streetlight people Don't stop",
