    "cleaned_text": "(Richard Thompson) Oh says Red Molly to James \"That's a fine motorbike. A girl could feel special on any such like\" Says James to Red Molly \"My hat's off to you It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952. And I've seen you at the corners and cafes it seems Red hair and black leather, my favourite colour scheme\" And he pulled her on behind and down to Boxhill they did ride Oh says James to Red Molly \"Here's a ring for your right hand But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man. For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen, I robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine. Now I'm 21 years, I might make 22 And I don't mind dying, but for the love of you. And if fate should break my stride Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride\" \"Come down, come down, Red Molly\" called Sergeant McRae \"For they've taken young James Adie for armed robbery. Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside. Oh come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside\" When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left He was running out of road, he was running out of breath But he smiled to see her cry He said \"I'll give you my Vincent to ride\" Says James \"In my opinion, there's nothing in this world Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl. Now Nortons and Indians and Greeves won't do, Ah, they don't have a soul like a Vincent 52\" Oh he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys Said \"I've got no further use for these. I see angels on Ariels in leather and chrome, Swooping down from heaven to carry me home\" And he gave her one last kiss and died And he gave her his Vincent to ride.",
