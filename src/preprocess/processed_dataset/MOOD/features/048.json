Golden words he will pour in your ear, But his lies can't disguise what you fear, For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her, It's the kiss of death from Mister Goldfinger. Pretty girl beware of this heart of gold This heart is cold. Golden words he will pour in your ear, But his lies can't disguise what you fear, For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her, It's the kiss of death from Mister Goldfinger. Pretty girl beware of this heart of gold This heart is cold. He loves only gold, Only gold. He loves gold. He loves only gold, Only gold. He loves gold.",
