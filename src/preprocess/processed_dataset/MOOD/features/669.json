    "cleaned_text": "I was walking up Sixth Avenue when Balloon Man came right up to me He was round and fat and spherical With the biggest grin I'd ever seen He bounced on up toward me But before we could be introduced He blew up very suddenly I guess his name was probably Bruce And I laughed like I always do And I cried like I cried for you And Balloon Man blew up in my hand He spattered me with tomatoes, Hummus, chick peas And some strips of skin So I made a right on 44th And I washed my hands when I got in And it rained like a slow divorce And I wish I could ride a horse And Balloon Man blew up in my hand I was walking up Sixth Avenue when Balloon Man blew up in my face There were loads of them on Bryant Park So I didn't feel out of place There must have been a plague of them On the TV when I came home late They were guzzling marshmallows and They're jumping off the Empire State And I laughed like I always do And I cried like I cried for you And Balloon Man blew up in my hand Balloon Man blew up in my hand",
