    "cleaned_text": "Who you tryin' ta mess with ese? Don't you know I'm loco? To da one on da flam Boy it's tough I just toss that ham in the fryin' pan Like spam It's done when I come in Slam Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam Don't make me wrek ya hectic Automatic got me goin' like Gen'ral Electric Damn The lights are blinking I'm thinking It's all over when I go out drinking Oh Makin' my mind slow, That's why I don't fuck wit da big four-oh Bro I got ta' maintain 'cause a nigga like me is goin' insane [Chorus: x4] Insane in the membrane Insane in the brain! Do my shit undercover Now it's time for for the blubber Blabber To watch dat belly get fatter Fat boy on a diet Don't try it I'll check your ass like a looter in a riot Much too fast like a sumo slammin' dat ass Leavin' your face in the grass You know I don't take a chulo Lightly Bitch just jealous 'cause he can't outwrite me So kick that style, wicked Wild Happy face nigga never seen me smile Whip dat mainframe I'll explain A nigga like me is goin' insane [Chorus: x4] Like Louie Armstrong Play the trumpet, I'll hit dat bong And break ya off somethin' soon I got ta get my props Cops Come and try ta' snatch my crops These pigs want to blow my house down Head underground To the next town They get mad when they come to raid my pad And I'm off in the night blue scad Yes I'm the pirate Pilot Of this ship if I get wit' the ultraviolet dream Hide from the red light beam Now do you believe in the unseen Look But don't make ya' eyes strain A nigga like me is goin' insane [Chorus: x4]",
