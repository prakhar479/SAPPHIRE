None of your fucking business But now I'm lying here Knowing that business had a name, But now I'm a number 1 2 3 repeater Down by law, I've got this nasty habit When I need something I reach out and grab it Once upon a time I had a name and a way But to you I'm nothing but a number 1 2 3 repeater Did you hear something outside? It sounded like a gun Stay away from that window boy It's not anyone we know Only about ourselves and what we read in the paper Don't you know ink washes out easier than blood But we don't have to try it And we don't have to buy it Repeater",
