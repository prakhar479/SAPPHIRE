    "cleaned_text": "Ten years ago on a cold dark night There was someone was killed neath the town hall light There were few at the scene but they all agreed That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me The judge said son what is your alibi If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die I spoke not a word though it meant my life For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife She walks these hills in a long black veil She visits my grave when the night winds wail Nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me The scaffold was high and eternity near She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans In the long black veil she cries o'er my bones She walks these hills in a long black veil She visits my grave when the night winds wail Nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me",
