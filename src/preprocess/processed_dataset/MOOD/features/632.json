    "cleaned_text": "'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Suddenly I heard a strange noise down below, so in my flanel pyjamas, on my tippy toe, I couldn't see anything from the spot where I stood, so I slid down the bannister, just as fast as I could. All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth (thweeth) My two front teeth (thweeth) See, my two front teeth. (thweeth) Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth (thweeth) Then I could wish you Merry Chrissmass. It seems so long since I could say: Sister Susie sitting on a thistle Every time I try to speak all I do is whistle: ssssssss. All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth My two front teeth (thweeth) See, my two front teeth. (thweeth thweeth) Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth Then I could wish you Merry Chrissmass. (Jingle Bells) Good old Santa Claus and all his reindeer, they used to bring me lots of toys and candy But now when I go out and call: 'Dancer, Prancer, Donner and Blitzen', none of them can understand me All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth My two front teeth (thweeth) My two front teeth.(thweeth thweeth) All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth So I can wish you Merry Chrissmass. Chrissmass - Chrissmass - oh, for goodness sakes: Happy New Year!",
