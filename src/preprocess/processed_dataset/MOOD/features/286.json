    "cleaned_text": "Early in the evenin' just about supper time, Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind. Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up. Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp. Down on the corner, out in the street, Willy and the Poorboys are playin'; Bring a nickel; tap your feet. Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile, Blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while. Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo. Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo. Down on the corner, out in the street, Willy and the Poorboys are playin'; Bring a nickel; tap your feet. Down on the corner, out in the street, Willy and the Poorboys are playin'; Bring a nickel; tap your feet. You don't need a penny just to hang around, But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down? Over on the corner there's a happy noise. People come from all around to watch the magic boy. Down on the corner, out in the street, Willy and the Poorboys are playin'; Bring a nickel; tap your feet. Down on the corner, out in the street, Willy and the Poorboys are playin'; Bring a nickel; tap your feet. Down on the corner, out in the street, Willy and the Poorboys are playin'; Bring a nickel; tap your feet.",
