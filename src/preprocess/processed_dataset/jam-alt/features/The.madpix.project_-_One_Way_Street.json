    "cleaned_text": "Tears are like diamonds in my eyes Blind me so now you're out of sight It's enough, it's too late to break this silence In a rose-coloured view of us I got lost, could I realize All your lies would be blades and knives To stab me inside Who will save you from this dark? Who will fix your selfish heart? A one way street, that's how you live Why do you always take and never give? Wide awake, yeah, I've crossed the line I'm coming home I'm running back to real life Through the start Where I could breathe in freely, baby Can't you see we ran off time Chasin' happiness while you get what you need (get what you need) There's nothing left of us but bleeding blades and knives Tonight you'll know how it feels A one way street, that's how you live Why do you always take and never give? I'll walk away to help you see Our love is rolling down so easily A one way street (Oh-oh-oh) A one way street (oh, you're a one way street) You never give (oh, you're a one way street) I'll walk away (oh, you're a one way street) So easily (oh, you're a one way street)",
